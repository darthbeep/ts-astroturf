My ex-girlfriend of several years was extremely physically abusive to me for the last two years of our relationship and I couldn't take the violence anymore so I left. Because of her mental condition I tried to stay her friend so I could be there for her if she needed anything and she spent the entire time trying to get me to get back with her, or guilting me for having a new girlfriend. My life was going great. My band was starting to get international attention, I was playing out of town and I have a beautiful, supportive partner. But then she made an anonymous call-out post about me, saying I had spent all those years violently raping and hitting her and sent it to hundreds of people. In this environment no one would dare question her, so I've lost everything. I lost my band, I don't have a job, and most of my friends who tried to stick by me were publicly branded \"rape apologists\" so I've lost them too. My life was amazing just a few months ago and now it's in shambles, and though my friends know the truth, no one will stand up for me out of fear of retaliation. My girlfriend has been wonderful and has also stuck by my side, but my ex's friends have made her life a living hell as a result. They're trying to convince everyone that I am also abusive to her, including by contacting her work place which was humiliating for her. I've always considered myself an ally to feminism and the #metoo movement. All it took was an email and my abuser quickly turned into my victim, and no one seems to care about all the evidence (photos, texts, witnesses) I have that she was very violent with me. It's very sad to be thrown completely under the bus when you don't further the narrative.  EDIT: Thanks for the gold, and for all the support I've received here. It's a daily struggle to wake up and remember that the amazing life I was just living is over, but all the encouragement here has me feeling a bit more motivated to keep gathering evidence and continue to fight this. ", "This is what is happening to me right now.

There is actually more to this confession but it's hard to anomolize it.  https://imgur.com/a/p7q90  That didn't stop a false rape fantasy story to be spread through the dorms and is regularly read by this group of students in public.  https://imgur.com/a/jYmFC  Some students, believing the rumors in ernest, have begun stalking me and keeping tabs on me around campus  https://imgur.com/a/nUFj3  After speaking out about this and how my ex sexually assaulted me, I found out that some people harbored violent fantasies about me and how I should be dealt with.  https://imgur.com/a/olMl9  I attempted to get the university's administration to do something about this, but instead they assured the other students they would not be in serious trouble.  https://imgur.com/a/lr8Q7  I was also coerced our of my private lease agreement near school by the administration and have been homeless ever since.

Also, if people feel like they can get away with making false allegations, they will do it more often, and this makes real allegations seem less legitimate. You wonder why police sometimes don't believe a victim, and this is why. They did a study on rapes reported in a university, and they found that about 5% of the reports were PROVEN to be false after investigating (even getting the accuser to confess the charges were made up in most cases), and another 30% were never escalated because they were either believed to be false or there wasn't enough reliable information to really do anything with it.

Viral research is one of the burgeoning fields, along with gene therapy/expression/modification, RNA, cytotoxins, etc.  Each presents its own unique technical and ethical challenges but also offer an incredibly diverse range of medical uses.  On the subject of viruses, our human genome has been greatly affected by viruses throughout our evolutionary history and some of their work can still be seen in our very own genetic makeup.  While on the surface a ban on \"lethal viruses\" may make sense, consider that there are many substances that are extremely lethal that humans have used in surprising ways.  The example of anthrax comes to mind, one of the most deadly substances per unit mass known to man.  I worked on a process anthrax toxin for the express purpose of making antidotes for the US government.  Sure it seems really shady but in reality, the entire process is quite banal and there are many safeguards in place to ensure that the material is not abused/weaponized.  Another example is with botulism toxin.  As it turns out, under the right conditions and dosage, it is instrumental in treating sarcoplasmic diseases.  Funny enough, the most widespread use is, of course, cosmetic.  There are already some really nasty viruses out there, hepatitis being a major one, yet there is relatively little fear against it compared to something like HIV due to mainly social stigma.  Hepatitis can survive far longer than HIV outside the human body and Hep C, while there now are a few drugs in late-stage development or maybe even commercial, is still quite a nasty disease considering there are proven and effective treatments for HIV.    There are so many other viruses that are immensely abundant, such as MMV (or MVM) that are almost omnipresent but people rarely even think about, or in the case of bovine and porcine viruses, people wolf down pounds and pounds of meat month after month without a single thought to the immunogenic effects, even if those viruses are not often \"lethal.\"  What is abundantly clear though is that everyone, including the general public, shares the responsibility in ensuring that manufacturers make products that are safe.

Since you mention your broad findings about the religious schools, I was wondering how the religiously unaffiliated schools stack up? Do they too take ideological shortcuts or use discriminatory admissions practices? Or do they generally stack up reasonably well? Is access to them distributed reasonably equitably?", "Great reporting Rebecca.  I *taught* at one of these schools.  It did NOT happen intentionally.   I am an atheist, but through a strange set of circumstances, I was more or less pushed into a position in a creationist+6000 year old earth Christian school.   I'd explain the entire background of my unexpected (and unlikely) hiring process, but doing so would probably \"out\" me. If you're looking for a more general explanation... People had made assumptions about me and my beliefs, and had set up the interview for me. I was unaware what position I was interviewing for until I was already sitting down with the person who hired me.  Given their deep connections with the local school districts, I was afraid those same people involved in this interview might cause me to be potentially black-balled or otherwise make it difficult for me to find teaching employment in the area if I didn't nod my head and complete the interview. Obviously, religion runs deep even within public school system (some states may vary in this, but in public education I worked with some exceptionally religious people), and telling people \"Hey, I'm an atheist\" during any kind of teaching position interview isn't a terribly good way to secure the job.  I was also curious, at that point, what education looked like inside one of these institutions... and this was my chance to see it first hand. It's an opportunity most people in my particular line of thinking would never get. They also offered me a substantially higher salary than I could have received at a local public school, and the small class sizes were appealing (local public schools have class sizes of 35 and 40 students, whereas I was being offered classes that ranged from 6 to 20 students).  I took the job. I told myself, what's the worst that could happen? I'd keep my head down, teach science, and get through the year.  They made it clear I wasn't supposed to talk about age of the earth. I was able to teach evolution as a \"theory\", but I was also supposed to explain exactly why that theory is wrong.  Full disclosure: I never got around to explaining why the theory of evolution was bullshit... it must have slipped my mind...  I also fielded numerous calls from some kind of hyper-christian group that wanted to take my students on a field trip to show them geological proof of the young Earth. Strangely, my class never found time to take that field trip either.  We had meetings where faculty talked about our school as a battlefield, and our students as spiritual warriors that we were sending out into the world. We had to indoctrinate those students and \"armor them\" against the bias and false science and narratives that people would use to try and strip away their religion.  In one meeting, they played a video from Bill Nye in a faculty meeting and at the end of it, pointed to him and said \"He's going to hell\", followed by claps and hoots and hollers... which I found particularly amusing.  The students were being indoctrinated from pre-school all the way through to high school graduation. They are taught not just to deny science, but to actively shout against it. Evolution, geological age of the earth, global warming, it's all one big anti-christian conspiracy.  During instruction on Ecology, I had to get creative in order to teach about the dangers of global warming without actually saying the words \"global warming\". The students thought climate change was bullshit.   I did my best, from the inside, to teach *actual* science. I faced heat from some parents (like when we had a group discussion about the human benefit of vaccination... which led me to learn that multiple students in my classroom were never vaccinated by their parents), but by and large I made it through the year celebrated by parents, students, and staff.  I was proud of what I accomplished. I feel that I moved the needle as far as I could from the inside. For the students I reached, at least, science was real. I hope they grow to appreciate that.  I will *never* do it again. Keeping up the charade while attempting to teach those students genuine scientific process and the critical thinking they need for the future was incredibly draining on me. In many ways, I think the things I experienced in that school are the reason I'm no longer in the profession.  The idea that vouchers and tax dollars helped pay for the things students were learning in those four walls is deeply unsettling.

The criteria apply to provisions that:  * do not produce a change in outlays or revenues;  * produce changes in outlays or revenue which are merely incidental to the non-budgetary components of the provision; * are outside the jurisdiction of the committee that submitted the title or provision for inclusion in the reconciliation measure;  * increase outlays or decrease revenue if the provision's title,   * as a whole, fails to achieve the Senate reporting committee's reconciliation instructions;  * increase net outlays or decrease revenue during a fiscal year after the years covered by the reconciliation bill unless the provision's title, as a whole, remains budget neutral;  * contain recommendations regarding the OASDI (social security) trust funds.  **Exceptions to the Byrd Rule:**  Section 313(b)(2) allows certain otherwise covered Senate-originated provisions to be excepted from the Byrd rule if the provisions are certified for exemption by the Senate Budget Committee chairman and ranking minority member, as well as the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee of jurisdiction. The permitted exceptions are:  * a provision that mitigates direct effects attributable to a second provision which changes outlays or revenue when the provisions together produce a net reduction in outlays; * the provision will result in a substantial reduction in outlays or a substantial increase in revenues during fiscal years after the fiscal years covered by the reconciliation bill; * the provision will likely reduce outlays or increase revenues based on actions that are not currently projected by CBO for scorekeeping purposes; or  * such provision will likely produce significant reduction in outlays or increase in revenues, but due to insufficient data such reduction or increase cannot be reliably estimated.  **Effect of points of order:**  The effect of raising a point of order under the Byrd rule is to strike the offending extraneous provision. If a point of order against a conference report is sustained, the Senate may consider subsequent motions to dispose of that portion of the conference report not subject to the point of order.   **Waivers**:   The Byrd rule is not self-enforcing. A point of order must be raised at the appropriate time to enforce it. The Byrd rule can only be waived *by a 3/5 (60) majority vote of the Senate*.

Scamming piece of shit.", "TL;DR: I've always supported public schools but I've used a voucher program for a non-religious school for the first time this year and I think there's some rare but real merit for secular, special needs schools that the religious schools are fucking up. The article doesn't really touch on schools like that or the population of secular special needs students who are attending religious schools as last resorts, so I wrote a long comment about it. Just more stuff to think about.  I checked in with the related AMA earlier and saw that this article focused only on the percentage of voucher schools that have religious affiliations. The thoughts I'd like to share weren't really appropriate for an AMA because of that, but as a comment on the topic voucher programs that loosely relate to ones like this it might serve a more appropriate purpose. Still, this might be all over the damn place, this comment.  The debate over public school funding and subsidies that create these voucher programs for private schools has only recently become important to me, and I find myself very much caught in the middle. My children have had access to a voucher for private school choice for several years, now, due to mild but pervasive disabilities that require specialized education plans. For the most part, I felt a public school's special needs provisions could work for us--the level of need was very borderline in most cases, though in a very Mary Quite Contrary way. When they're good, they're great. When things are bad, though, it's just awful. Until recently, however, I felt the public school options were still better than what I could find covered by the voucher programs (that is, mostly religious-based schools with nominal coverage for special needs, and secular special needs schools with dubious credentials and techniques).  In our surrounding districts, the public school boards have pushed a policy of inclusion for special needs children, but the past two years have really shown a change in basic philosophy. The phrasing I've heard swirls around ideas that since all children have unique needs and everyone should be treated as special. Students with disabilities should be given a majority amount of time in mainstream classes in order to not feel isolated from society and for non-disabled children to learn how to cooperate with peers who have special circumstances. That sounds great and I do absolutely agree with that premise, but in practice--at least, in the early stages of transitioning a district-wide approach--many children are just too vulnerable to cope with the hiccups and challenges in changing the way things are done.  There aren't enough workshops and seminars around to catch up teachers trained for general education classroom management on how to handle children with more severe needs. Specialists are still kept on staff and the idea is that they rotate and monitor classes and help build educational and behavioral plans with the primary instructors, but the resources available for public school students with disabilities and intensive needs are already severely lacking and this just stretches how they're used even further. I had to choose a voucher program this year after my child was in crisis and injured due to unlicensed and inexperienced staff at the public school trying to restrain him while waiting for the trained faculty to arrive on scene. They were busy across campus with another student in crisis.   It was an incredibly difficult decision and I think I'm pretty lucky that a local school that specializes in education for children with severe autism was ready to expand their program for students on the more high-functioning side of the scale this year. The list of schools for children on the spectrum and other related behavioral disabilities is pretty small around here. This was the only one that fully integrated some proven and promising therapeutic techniques for children with needs like these; I didn't see that same level of training for staff and faculty for other secular, autism-related schools. Those schools are also often operating unchecked by certain important regulations in place for public and charter schools, and as such can be for-profit fronts that say they serve special needs but are then woefully under-equipped and untrained for it. In fact, this school that I chose was only expanding after being asked to take over the location of a former school for autistic children that had been shut down for defrauding the families and not providing appropriate services.   I think there's an important link between how common that is for non-religious schools and why parents who might not be very interested in religious education itself will turn to those private schools anyway because their choices are so limited. The religious schools will say they provide services, but it's usually arranged a lot like the public school system in that there's a mainstream class experience and expectation that comes with monitored, rotating support. Still, they get a lot of special needs students if parents are tired of the public school issues--parents often don't realize, though, that they give up certain rights when they transfer to a private school like that.   In a public school system, a child with a disability and personalized education plan cannot be refused (i.e. expelled) educational services by the district--it may be that the child is moved from one class to another or from one school to another, and that can sometimes wind up meaning the child can only attend a very juvenile-detention-like setup, but the district is still required by law to provide something no matter what. Once a parent withdraws their child from their local district to put them in a private school, the local district no longer has enforcement obligations and the state's truancy requirements are satisfied by the private school registration. The special needs/disability designation only guarantees funding for the private school; they can and will expel students with special needs if their behaviors are too extreme according to their own policies. Parents then face struggling to transfer funding to some other private school (usually meaning they have to deal with out of pocket expenses at some point) if that school will even agree to accept a student who has already been kicked out--or they have to go back to a public school system that has already run out of viable options.   I worry that the very legitimate concerns about how these voucher programs are being used by the majority of private and religious schools is going to wreck the incredibly important but extremely rare schools that are secular, science-based and necessary for certain families. The current churn that is a public school experience just isn't working for so many students as it is, so I know it's all the more important to focus resources and efforts on improving that system, I've always voted to support measures to increase that funding. I just find it incredibly stressful to now be caught in a very real and difficult middle-ground given a multitude of current circumstances.  I think that's all the thoughts I wanted to shout into the void. I wonder if any other parents have seen this happen in their districts.", "The main problem here is federal support for voucher programs. It really is an attempt to privatize public education such that corporations can milk parents of money while, at the same time, teaching subjects which indoctrinate children in specific ways.  Inevitably, parents have ultimate control over their kid's education, so these sorts of schools will exist one way or another, but public funding should only be going to schools that satisfy basic educational needs and meet fundamental requirements in their curricula.   Not sure how much I trust the Huffington Post, but these texts do look pretty alarming. The text is bizarre and makes you worry about how widespread this will get.

In a moderately low tax state.   Which to be honest I'd be fine with, $4-$5k isn't really of that much concern for me over the course of 12 months, and if it means major tax reform then I'll benefit in other ways, but It's not really major reform for most Americans, and I feel like this is the last time we will see taxes touched for 20+ years.  The thing that really worries me though is how toned down the original corporate tax changes became, and how little overall simplification there was on the personal side. that whole \"everyone can now do their taxes on a postcard\" thing was dumb because the vast majority of Americans can literally do their taxes in 10 minutes with their final pay stub, google, and a calculator. Now the IRS site might be a shitshow for filing them, but for most people taxes are pretty simple already. But all that ridiculously complex tax code shit that really only effects businesses and maybe 20-30% of total tax filers, is what prevents us from getting closer to a simple flat tax that would ideally get to 0% at some point, and we'd just pay tax on what we consume.   While I think this is really good for the corporate side of things, the fact is that those are only around 10% of total tax receipts annually as it is, so I'd have liked to see a much lager corporate bill first, get the economic growth, and then get major individual tax reform when the GOP took 60 seats in the senate come next years midterms. As was what I originally though they were going to do after the election and it seemed like Trump/GOP had a lot of momentum.   Instead you get a pretty good corporate tax bill, that will probably add around 1-1.5% to our productivity, and a moderate tax cut for the majority of Americans who have normal income, that's paid for by a trillion dollars or so of deficit spending, along with moderate tax increases on wealthy people in high tax states, but we had to \"pay for tax cuts\" somehow, and don't dare talk about spending reform, but whatever, something is better than nothing.  Except if this is all we get for the next decade or two then it's pretty underwhelming for the average american. I'm not saying it's bad, and while I say that $4-$5k is pretty immaterial to me, that ~$400 extra a month to the average middle class family could be a massive benefit. But I'd like to see it be bigger, and I'd like to see continued reforms/cuts to the business side of things to get us more in line with nations like Ireland, Singapore, or Hong-Kong. I'd like America to be the place companies come to as a tax haven.   What's likely to happen though, is the tax collection increase we see from moderate productivity growth, along with the decent growth we will get from de-regulation at the executive level, will just be justification for larger deficit spending in the future, refusal to look at entitlement reform, and \"hey we passed the biggest tax cut ever\" so why would they ever go back to make it better down the road.

Most of the tax cuts will take effect in January, and many workers will see bigger paychecks from reduced tax withholding by February.  > The Republican plan offers deep tax cuts for businesses, lower rates for many individuals and a narrower estate tax. Corporate shareholders, business owners and most households will win, at least in the first few years. But there will be losers, too, including some households living in regions where state and local taxes are high.  > The GOP tax bill isn\u2019t quite the biggest tax cut ever, as Mr. Trump often calls it. It does cut the corporate tax rate more than ever before in one single bill. But other tax cuts, most notably Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1981 program, were larger as a share of gross domestic product, according to Treasury Department analyses.  > Still, it is more than just a collection of tax cuts. It includes a fundamental rethinking of business taxation and international tax rules, and Republicans are challenging some cherished and once-sacrosanct tax breaks, shrinking the deduction for state and local taxes and making the mortgage interest deduction less valuable.  > Republicans reaped the benefits of three elections\u2014the takeover of the House in 2010, the Senate flip in 2014 and Mr. Trump\u2019s surprise victory last year.

That, too, is a new idea, one that tax experts warn is fraught with unknowns, because it could unleash a flurry of aggressive tax maneuvering by businesses to reap the benefits of an untested system.  > Republicans argue the tax plan will spur much faster economic growth and pay for itself, though the official estimates say that argument is overstated. The House and Senate bills would produce modest growth and add $1 trillion to projected budget deficits over the next decade, after accounting for that expansion, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the nonpartisan congressional tax scorekeeper.  > \u201cWhere are the vaunted Republican deficit hawks?\u201d asked House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) on the House floor. \u201cAre they endangered?

They dropped some of the most controversial ideas, including first-in, first-out accounting for stock sales, which stood to boost capital-gains taxes for investors, the repeal of the deduction for medical expenses and taxes on graduate-student tuition waivers.  > The final plan nearly doubles the standard deduction, lowers marginal tax rates for individuals and doubles the child tax credit to $2,000. The top rate goes to 37% from 39.6%, while tax rates for capital gains and dividends are untouched. The bill shrinks the alternative minimum tax so 200,000 people will pay it instead of 5.2 million. It doubles the estate-tax exemption to $11.2 million per person, so fewer than 0.2% of estates will pay it.  > It also takes away some longstanding tax breaks for individuals. The state and local tax deduction gets a $10,000 cap, and the personal exemption disappears. Incentives for mortgages and charitable contributions shrink, because the larger standard deduction means fewer households will itemize their deductions.

The middle 20% of households will get a tax cut averaging $930, amounting to 1.6% of after-tax income. Households in the top 1% get an average tax cut in 2018 of $51,140, or 3.4% of after-tax income. That is not universal; 9% of households in that top group will get a tax increase averaging $93,910.  > The plan cuts taxes for all income groups, on average, and it slightly shifts the remaining tax burden toward households making $100,000 and $200,000 and those making more than $1 million in 2019, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation.  > Those effects fade over time and then dramatically change after 2025, when the individual income tax cuts are scheduled to expire and a tougher measure of inflation remains in place to push people into higher tax brackets.

They pointed to Congress\u2019s decisions in 2010 and 2013 to extend most of former President George W. Bush\u2019s expiring tax cuts.

Authoritarianism is a form of government characterized by strong central power and limited political freedoms. Individual freedoms are subordinate to the state and there is no constitutional accountability under an authoritarian regime.[1] Juan Linz's influential 1964 description of authoritarianism[2] characterized authoritarian political systems by four qualities:  Limited political pluralism, that is such regimes place constraints on political institutions and groups like legislatures, political parties and interest groups; A basis for legitimacy based on emotion, especially the identification of the regime as a necessary evil to combat \"easily recognizable societal problems\" such as underdevelopment or insurgency; Minimal social mobilization most often caused by constraints on the public such as suppression of political opponents and anti-regime activity; Informally defined executive power with often vague and shifting powers.[3] Modern democratic elective dictatorships use an authoritarian concept to form a government  AKA the FCC making a ruling that ignores public out cry ...     I could tease this out more and more ... go watch the CLONE WARS ( the best star wars as if the movies were made for it )   Let us not forget ... FEAR is what rules VADER ... and FEAR is what motivates most conservatives ... and FEAR is the core of the republican party .. Fear of OTHER ...    Lets not miss out how ... The empire represents the Nazis... Who the republicans sympathize with ... First it was a republic .. then power was garbed due to fabricated wars to gain power and control .... then then it became an oppressive Nazi regime... This is where we see how government works with Corporation or powerful men to control the public ...     That brings us to the word Fascism...  Fascism /\u02c8f\u00e6\u0283\u026az\u0259m/ is a form of radical authoritarian nationalism,[1][2] characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition and control of industry and commerce[3] that came to prominence in early 20th-century Europe.[4] The first fascist movements emerged in Italy during World War I before it spread to other European countries.[4] Opposed to liberalism, Marxism and anarchism, fascism is usually placed on the far-right within the traditional left\u2013right spectrum.[5][6][7][4][8][9]  Fascists saw World War I as a revolution that brought massive changes to the nature of war, society, the state and technology. The advent of total war and the total mass mobilization of society had broken down the distinction between civilians and combatants. A \"military citizenship\" arose in which all citizens were involved with the military in some manner during the war.[10][11] The war had resulted in the rise of a powerful state capable of mobilizing millions of people to serve on the front lines and providing economic production and logistics to support them, as well as having unprecedented authority to intervene in the lives of citizens.[10][11]     soooooooo ..... i hope i have teased out how wrong ted cruz is on his break down of star wars ( wish i had some writing skills... dislexica sucks .. but i do know the meanings of words and star wars ) ", "Texas 2018 Election   [Primary Election Registration Deadline](http://www.votetexas.gov/register-to-vote/): February 5, 2018   [Primary Election](https://teamrv-mvp.sos.texas.gov/MVP/mvp.do): March 6, 2018   [General Election Registration Deadline](http://www.votetexas.gov/register-to-vote/): October 9, 2018   [General Election](https://teamrv-mvp.sos.texas.gov/MVP/mvp.do): November 6, 2018   ", "Oh Ted.... Smh "], "Liberal": ["I feel for you. I'm a 68-year-old very liberal (almost completely socialist actually). I'm seriously worried what is going to happen to educated persons like yourself (and myself). I know a quote that you might find useful when you talk to a repug: When you argue with an idiot they drag you down to their level and beat you with experience. I am quoting Mark Twain aka Samuel Clemens. He was alive from 1835 to 1910. When you encounter what I will call an idiot, just walk away. They are not going to learn anything new. They are either too stupid or lazy between the ears.  We are living in a time where we are at a point of having a dictatorship. Aldous Huxley (1931) said this: The perfect dictatorship would have the appearance of a democracy, but would be a prison without walls in which the prisoners would not even dream of escaping. It would essentially be a system of slavery where, through consumption and entertainment, the slaves would love their servitude.  This should help you understand the conservative thought of today. They are just lazy, stupified, between the ears or are in denial of the truth out of fear. If they were to take a serious look at their situation they would likely implode mentally.  America, stolen from the natives is a nation of thieves and has been,  since the country as we call it formed. Since the end of the great depression, created by the wealthy we have become a warfare nation, yet most like your mother don't believe it.  We make war to make the wealthy wealthier. I fear that tRump will eventually, if we are not lucky enough to remove him, will get us involved in some kind of war or a world war. In fact, a world war would be even better for the wealthy since it would reduce the population and make it easier for them to make virtual slaves of the surviving populace and increase their power and wealth. I fear this may come true due to the, well, idiots we are surrounded with.   Personally I hope that I die before then, but certainly, worry for those younger than me and such a bleak future.  My recommendation is to continue to educate yourself so that you will be intelligent enough to prevent this possibility. You and the other younger people of today must find a way to civilize not only this country and the world, but also engender the thought that this can be done with lots of work. Teach others what you know. If it is an idiot in front of you, walk away, for they are lost.  The U.S. is not a Xtian nation, in fact it is far from it. Religion is a tool of those who teach ignorance so that people can be controlled. It is very important to resist this. And example of this ignorance is the Vatican and what it teaches. So many people under the thumb of what amounts to a privileged billionaire who teaches a fairy tale. I could include the Muslims here as well. So many people, so ignorant that they broadcast video of a child sawing the head off of an 'infedel' in the name of Islam. Religion is such a waste.  There are many people that you should listen to. If you can get your hands on some (or all, as I have) of what George Carlin had to say in his final years. He was a genius with words and ideas. Had John Lennon lived longer we would have been taught more about peace and being educated.  My rule of my life is: Question Everything--all of the time.  There is so much I could write here, but I don't want to write a book for you. But know this: With your computer you have the whole planet at your hands. Make friends with those who are like you no matter where they are. Use the knowlege that is available here. And live a free and informed life my friend. Today: RESIST! Resist ignorance and slavery.  And please, try to enjoy your life knowing what is right and what is very wrong....We are a people,not a race or races, and geo-political borders are unnecessary. We are those who have one planet and we must try to make it better for all people or we will extinguish ourselves.  Thank you for reading this and good luck in your life. With regards....Jack E.
