{"Liberal": ["Right... it was absurdly unpopular.  Latest polls had something like 33% support, 55% opposition to it.  That's not how you serve your constituents.\n", "The word you're looking for is \"epistemology\".  Sad to say, the average person (at least in this country) doesn't know what the word means (which is OK) or incorporate such a concept in their worldview (not OK IMHO).  Some people just never ask the question \"how do I know X\" -- they just declare they know what their emotions lead them to believe is true.\n\nI can't put across in words how horrific this is.  Example: I remember like 5-6 years ago a video went around conservative circles, about \"OMG the Russians know Obama isn't a genuine leader -- they won't shake his hand!\"\n\nIt was a short clip without sound, showing Obama clearly in Russia (standing around with Russian generals) and a line of people in front of him who refuse to shake his hand.  The comments are full of things like \"OMG Obama looked annoyed when the second guy refused to shake his hand, but did you see the look on his face when the third guy refused?  OMG LOL I thought he was going to start screaming LOL!\"\n\nThere were a few commenters who were like \"Please stop this -- the video is Obama introducing his staff to the Russians -- he just makes hand motions that look kind of like he's trying to shake hands\".\n\nI mean, if human beings can be so deluded as to look at videos of a calm Obama performing routine courtesies, and see a furious Obama being put in his place by foreign leaders who know the truth about how the Kenyan isn't a legitimate president, there is little hope for humanity in general.  ", "I feel for you. I'm a 68-year-old very liberal (almost completely socialist actually). I'm seriously worried what is going to happen to educated persons like yourself (and myself). I know a quote that you might find useful when you talk to a repug: When you argue with an idiot they drag you down to their level and beat you with experience. I am quoting Mark Twain aka Samuel Clemens. He was alive from 1835 to 1910. When you encounter what I will call an idiot, just walk away. They are not going to learn anything new. They are either too stupid or lazy between the ears.\n\nWe are living in a time where we are at a point of having a dictatorship. Aldous Huxley (1931) said this: The perfect dictatorship would have the appearance of a democracy, but would be a prison without walls in which the prisoners would not even dream of escaping. It would essentially be a system of slavery where, through consumption and entertainment, the slaves would love their servitude.\n\nThis should help you understand the conservative thought of today. They are just lazy, stupified, between the ears or are in denial of the truth out of fear. If they were to take a serious look at their situation they would likely implode mentally.\n\nAmerica, stolen from the natives is a nation of thieves and has been,  since the country as we call it formed. Since the end of the great depression, created by the wealthy we have become a warfare nation, yet most like your mother don't believe it.\n\nWe make war to make the wealthy wealthier. I fear that tRump will eventually, if we are not lucky enough to remove him, will get us involved in some kind of war or a world war. In fact, a world war would be even better for the wealthy since it would reduce the population and make it easier for them to make virtual slaves of the surviving populace and increase their power and wealth. I fear this may come true due to the, well, idiots we are surrounded with. \n\nPersonally I hope that I die before then, but certainly, worry for those younger than me and such a bleak future.\n\nMy recommendation is to continue to educate yourself so that you will be intelligent enough to prevent this possibility. You and the other younger people of today must find a way to civilize not only this country and the world, but also engender the thought that this can be done with lots of work. Teach others what you know. If it is an idiot in front of you, walk away, for they are lost.\n\nThe U.S. is not a Xtian nation, in fact it is far from it. Religion is a tool of those who teach ignorance so that people can be controlled. It is very important to resist this. And example of this ignorance is the Vatican and what it teaches. So many people under the thumb of what amounts to a privileged billionaire who teaches a fairy tale. I could include the Muslims here as well. So many people, so ignorant that they broadcast video of a child sawing the head off of an 'infedel' in the name of Islam. Religion is such a waste.\n\nThere are many people that you should listen to. If you can get your hands on some (or all, as I have) of what George Carlin had to say in his final years. He was a genius with words and ideas. Had John Lennon lived longer we would have been taught more about peace and being educated.\n\nMy rule of my life is: Question Everything--all of the time.\n\nThere is so much I could write here, but I don't want to write a book for you. But know this: With your computer you have the whole planet at your hands. Make friends with those who are like you no matter where they are. Use the knowlege that is available here. And live a free and informed life my friend. Today: RESIST! Resist ignorance and slavery.\n\nAnd please, try to enjoy your life knowing what is right and what is very wrong....We are a people,not a race or races, and geo-political borders are unnecessary. We are those who have one planet and we must try to make it better for all people or we will extinguish ourselves.\n\nThank you for reading this and good luck in your life. With regards....Jack E. Alexander", "I come from a pretty conservative background and I even was a right wing, Ayn Rand, republican for a while.  Now, I feel like liberal might be too right wing of label for me so maybe I can help.\n\nTry to keep it simple.  With people I don\u2019t know that well I use simple questions like \n\n>\u201cWhen has our current GOP government sided with workers over billionaire and big business?\u201d  \n\nThe GOP is so bad they can't answer.  This question establishes a conflict and frames it as we are both on the same side.\n\nWith your mom though you should probably get into her values and develop a frame that resonates with those values.  \n\nSo ask:\n\n* What's good about what's going on in the country\n* Where do you hope the country is going.\n* What's bad about what's going on in the country.\n* Where do you fear the country is going.\n\nUse the values she uses.  Like if she fears that liberals make the government too big and that will end in a dictatorship, obvious freedom, liberty and independence are important to her.  If it\u2019s something else like justice or something get to those values.\n\nThis is important, you can have all the facts and a logically sound argument, but if the values you are using are inequality and my politics is based off freedom and liberty that won\u2019t resonate with me. \n\nKnowing her values you can begin to show that liberals and her are on the same side. Build class solidarity, like your and liberal values are the same as hers.  You value freedom and liberty, you want everybody to be able to have a meaningful life.  \n\nNext you need to get to the situation we are in, this is called class consciousness.  She may have all these weird concerns like some college campus in the middle of nowhere has some weird policy.  Maybe she's worried that some guy will marry a dog and want a cake that a baker will have to make.  It\u2019s not an accident she has them, this is what right wing media does on purpose.  It\u2019s called false consciousness.  It\u2019s stuff in the way to obscure and prevent her from focusing on her current situation.  This is a hard one to break down, I would express your concerns about where we are and where we are headed here and tune them to her values again.  To be honest though there is no magic key, if there was we wouldn\u2019t be living in a fascist country.\n\nBut for somebody like me this is how I would say it:\n\n\n>\"In our country there is a conflict going on where people are fighting over who will have the power over the American economy. One side wants to set up society so that power is distributed more equally among Americans the other wants to concentrate that power into an elite few.  The concentration of power into this non-constitutionally restrained non-democratically controlled elite is a threat to our liberty.\" \n\n \n>\"I want a nation where everybody has the right to live a life with dignity.  If some people are destitute while others have thousands of times more money then I will make in a life I don\u2019t see how that is possible. What's the point of freedom of speech if I will starve or my kids will go without healthcare if I speak my mind?  Who cares if the government allows me to have property but a man worth $100 billion dollars can cut me out of the economy?  Is freedom merely a privilege unless it's enjoyed by one and all?\"\n\nAs far as conspiracy theories, I have had some success by framing it.\n\n>\"Why is there always a conspiracy that means we can't in anyway lessen the power of the richest people?\"", "I take it that your mother is older than you are.  A great question: why, as people get older, do they seem to get more conservative?  I've got an answer, though the non-misanthropic amongst us may not enjoy it.\n\nThe very definition of \"conservative\" is someone who believes that the established order should be upheld.  It does get a little more complex: when liberals have been in power and changed things, naturally the conservatives want change too -- they want to change things back.  MAGA!\n\nBut why do people ever retire?  Some apparently believe that their job was done, and done well: they're retiring in their old age because they got the entire world fixed up perfect, and you young people just need to keep it in the current state (i.e. be conservatives).  In their minds, they're like boxers who retire in glory undefeated, nothing left to do, no worlds left to conquer.\n\nAt the age of 57, I beg to differ.  Apparently, unlike most people, I've been actually getting fatter, dumber, slower, uglier, weaker, and even less sexually potent as I age.  I'm retiring because I can't really do my job well anymore: I have to trust in the young people to pick up where I left off, to continue the endless struggle to make the world a better place.  And that's why I'm an old liberal.", "Sounds like you and your mother are talking past each other. You're saying a policy is good for the economy, while she's saying she opposes it on other grounds, like people not deserving a higher minimum wage. Those sound like two completely different conversations, so I'm not surprised you can't agree. If she wants to talk about what people deserve then have that conversation instead and see what are her assumptions and arguments. That's my advice. ", "I'm in the exact same position as you. It's hard. Especially since being in between jobs, I've had to move back in with my parents and Fox News is on on 24/7. Their constant blaming my liberalness on my college education (which they are now horrified to have paid for) is especially hard on me because my career path has been academia. As of yet, I haven't found a solution except to bite my tongue. Most of the time this works, but it's REALLY hard, and sometimes I can't manage and there have been some blow ups. Please send me an IM if you want to talk. I would really truly love to have someone to commiserate with about this.  You're not alone. ", "In the summer of 2008 when the Democratic Primary was basically over and the general election was heating up my Dad took me from our home in Ohio (still a swing state at the time) down to Texas to visit our mostly very conservative family.  The election was all anyone really wanted to talk about even though there was really nothing that my progressive/liberal Dad could say that was going to break through the partisan entrenchment of our conservative relatives.  My Dad is for the most part a very mild-mannered guy.  He's very intelligent, but he does not like to hit people over the head with it.  He works as a college professor in a conservative rural community, so his job is basically to expose uninterested people to new ideas.  But whenever the conversation got too heated and unproductive my Dad would say in a kind of defeated sing-songy way \"You live in Texas.  Your vote doesn't matter.\"  This typically irritated my relatives enough to force a subject change.  When my Dad and I discussed this privately I told him he should probably stop saying that because it was only making the family madder.  He said \"I'm not really saying that for them, I'm saying it for me.\"\n\nIf there was ever a magical golden age where most Americans were curious and open-minded and willing to confront their preconceptions, it's long past.

I know quite a few conservatives too.  My theory is that many conservatives have quite literally been brain-washed by conservative news and conservative social media.  (Not all of them but many.)   See how almost all the below apply to fox news and other conservative news sources.\n\nHere are the most common brain-washing techniques:\n*  The manipulator offers you a number of choices, but the choices all lead to the same conclusion.\n*  The same idea or phrase is frequently repeated to make sure it sticks in your brain.\n*  Intense intelligence-dampening is performed by providing you with constant short snippets of information on various subjects. This trains you to have a short memory, makes the amount of information feel overwhelming, and the answers provided by the manipulator to be highly desired due to how overwhelmed you feel.\n* Emotional manipulation is used to put you in a heightened state, as this makes it harder for you to employ logic. Inducing fear and anger are among the most popular manipulated emotions.\n\nWhat can you do?  It's important to maintain communication with them.  Try to keep the topic off politics and focus on the things that you guys agree on and having close family moments.  This is assuming the person is treating you still with respect and isn't attacking you verbally even when you're following your policy of avoiding controversial topics.

No amount of logic or reasoning is going to change my parents' views on things, and the same can be said about many of those who vote Republican (and probably liberals too).

As is the case for many, my worldview was quite shattered after the election -- I had been overestimating our populace by quite a bit apparently, and I'm still working to reconcile this. I still want to push our society forward and invest more heavily in education, technology, climate, healthcare, etc... \n\nI think honestly we actually just need to refocus our efforts on the state, or even better, the city-level of government. I'm trying more and more to focus on those levels of government (which is a slightly conservative idea), and ideally a stronger coalition between cities to enact change.

He\u2019s also a great person who owns a Workers\u2019 Compensation Law Firm in California. He employs about 50 attorneys and 60 staff. Technically this is considered a small business. He also makes over $500k but less than 1 million.\n\nHis political views are typical of today\u2019s Republicans. Above all he wants to cut taxes.

How do you think you\u2019ll do that?* \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, probably advertising to bring in more clients.\u201d\n\n*Ok sounds like it will help business. Will you also pay your employees more?*\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean? Am I going to just give them more money for the job they\u2019re already doing?\u201d\n\n*Yes. The GOP and their economic policy is that tax breaks for business will trickle down to them.*\n\n\u201cSure and when I bring in more business the company will make more money.\u201d\n\n*But will that money eventually be passed on to employees and the middle class as the GOP says it will?*\n\n\u201cSure. Maybe not all but some.\u201d\n\n*But as an owner you would be the first to make more from increased profits right?*\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n*Then the attorney\u2019s right? They\u2019re the ones that make you money.*\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n*But all the attorneys make at least 100k most of them more. That\u2019s not really the middle class is it?*\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right but after them the staff will get more\u201d\n\n*So the staff, aka the middle class, will make more money after you invest your savings into your business, which in turn brings in more profit, after you take your cut and finally after the attorneys take their cut?*\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about this anymore\u201d\n\n*One last question!*\n\n\"Fine\"\n\n*Is there anything that would force you to invest in your business/employees instead of pocketing the money?*\n\n\"No\"\n\nThe End.\n", "Well, that's my generation fucked.

He is, says Mr Kagan, the monstrous result of the party\u2019s \u201cwild obstructionism\u201d, its demonisation of political institutions, its flirtation with bigotry and its \u201cracially tinged derangement syndrome\u201d over President Barack Obama.

No, they are angry about all the things Republicans have told them to be angry about these past seven-and-a-half years\u201d.\n\n>Mr Kagan is right, but does not go far enough.

Indeed, they go back all the way to the party\u2019s opportunistic response to the civil rights movement in the 1960s. Alas, they have become worse, not better, with time.\n\n>Why has this happened? The answer is that this is how a wealthy donor class, dedicated to the aims of slashing taxes and shrinking the state, obtained the footsoldiers and voters it required. This, then, is \u201cpluto-populism\u201d: the marriage of plutocracy with rightwing populism. Mr Trump embodies this union. But he has done so by partially dumping the free-market, low tax, shrunken government aims of the party establishment, to which his financially dependent rivals remain wedded.

Stupid) people *can be*, particularly around \"Upvoting With Their Gut/Feelings\". \n\nI hope everyone here considers *reading* up on the Political, Religious, Economic, Geopolitical / Global and Military history of the Russian Empire, then USSR, then Russian Federation for a more ***comprehensive, deep and critical understanding*** of \"Where they came from, Why they think/do these things, and How\".\n\nTake a look below, I've only been studying and following this \"Stuff\" for 15+ years.\n\n---\n\n...\n\nANYWAYS. \n\nNo surprise that Russia is our geopolitical foe. Particularly after WW2 and our establishment of a Western-Euro NATO zone and dependency on both ***trade and shipping routes*** to/from the Nordic, Baltic, Mediterranean, Arab and East African paths.\n\nTransport of naval, air and ground assets to protect these economic zones is critical, as well as the resources (Mineral, Natural Gas, Crude Oil) and very large, 50+ year, invested by the US tax bases - or, what our restructuring, economic and defense efforts created, particularly in France, UK, Germany, Italy, Poland, and a few other ancillary states (Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Friendly states in Middle east).\n\nWhether we like it or not as angsty-edgy early to mid 20's people on here, there is an absolute importance in dominating and protecting these zones. We can't think for a second that the Russian, Chinese and their proxy supported political groups aren't \"In It To Win It\". \n\n**Owning larger spheres of influence is the fastest way to accumulate and deploy meaningful wealth.**\n\nDisruption of those shipping lanes particularly, as well as destabilization of those political and economic allies, will hurt us.\n\nCompeting regimes are Autocratic and Repressive at worst, Corrupt Mafia Style Oligarchs at best. Geopolitics is a complex thing, but when you look at the past maneuvers, successes and failures, that's called History.\n\nIn summary, of course Russia has an interest in de-stabilizing us. You guys (often) forget that the only thing separating Russia and their ruling class establishment from Western, Liberal Democratic powers in Europe is literally a large, flat plain / fields. In the past, the USSR hedged against this by surrounding itself with satellite states, which are now gone and \"Up For Grabs\". With the loss of ***satellite states and protectorates***, not only does the defensive capability of Russia fall in 3rd place, but it also losses out on a large tax revenue base, trade base (free trade) and politically favorable conditions to expand their own business enterprises into.\n\nThe US does the same thing, except we have better political, economic and legal institutions by far compared to our geopolitical adversaries. And that continued success is threatening and destabilizing for them and their ruling class, who are feeling the pinch as sanctions continue and escalate from the world's largest consumers of ***their primary export resource, natural gas***.\n\nQuite honestly, the only thing stopping these actions from escalating is Nuclear weapons.\n\nWhich was why the efforts to expand US influence and partnerships, ***directly (state level) and indirectly (economic ties, political affiliations)*** was super super super important in the pre-ICMB, pre-Mass WMD age (40's, 50's and early 60's). Now, all state actors are left with is indirect methods to shift power. **Ironically, Democracy allows the rise of Authoritarian and Repressive regimes** and stakeholders to ***\"Win\" by votes***.\n\nHowever, States with established, controlled economies and parties (the reverse), particularly in the modern age, will need nothing short of a complete collapse or Coup for DIRECT shifts in power. But then, you typically see rampant extremism and populism because those countries have an influx of under/uneducated voters who are radicalized to the extreme left or the extreme right. The same method to suppress discontent and information re: Education Suppression is, again ironically, the downfall for post-dictatorship rebuilding.\n\nThis is why it's not a case of \"We're Doing The Same Thing As Them\", nor can you creatively re-direct your now conflicted soul with what-about ism's.... \"We have better political, economic and legal institutions by far compared to our geopolitical adversaries\". Our rationalism, intellectualism and critical thinking are a virtue and blessing that we enjoy through our upbringing and environment. We need to ENCOURAGE it, not belittle it (Re: half the posts on this thread. Shame.).\n\n*They might not be perfect*, and our ruling parties, businesses and citizens groups are often at odds with one another... however, overall (strategically), Freedom of Speech, Press, Religious Practice, Gun Ownership, Assembly, Petition of Government, No Quartering, Equal Justice, Private Property and many, many other freedoms are a ***basis for our institutional superiority and stability***.\n\n...\n\nPS - Respectfully, even if you are planning on \"Downvoting\" this, let's have a discussion and/or meaningful debate on the issue.\n\nI look forward to it! \n\nI'm particularly excited about citing references and linking useful resources, be prepared. :)", "I think we're doing a fine job on our own, thankyouverymuch.", "And they're winning.", "Yea, Trump and the Republicans want to destroy it, too.", "Trump and the Republican party do everything in their power to destroy US democracy yet American whites vote for them in by ridiculous margins due to white identity politics.

The funds they give merely sets up the ability to create value, it is then the workers who create value. It doesn't matter which shape funding takes, an investor is only relevant in our current system, because he is only a *type* of worker, however the very core principal of a worker is universal. In a totalitarian communist regime, one could make the very same argument about the state, \"they provide the equipment to produce value\", however the state itself does not produce any unique value such as the worker. \n\n\"*penalizing those who create value, and subsidizing those who only consume it*\" somehow assumes that the worker doesn't create value. While in fact the investors or owners contribute no extra value that is proportional to their wealth. They could be replaced by another entity, they themselves create no extra value, it is their FUNDS, and funds could very well come from another entity such as for example a cooperative. The value of the investors comes from their work as \"accountants\", not as the value of their funds, as that is a value inherent to the funds themselves, not the investor. \n\nWhether we then find it *fair* that they receive more money than the rest, is another debate. But the fact of the matter is that they do not produce any sort of significantly greater *value* than anyone else. Value =/= wealth.

They didn\u2019t even interview a single person who saw us out together that night. You have to pay to get that. Anyhow, it finally came out that 1) the hospital that conducted the rape kit and drug test lied about the results of a test (they didn\u2019t actually have the ability to conduct said test and said they did) 2) the woman had a history of accusing people all over the country and 3) the investigator in charge got caught on tape saying I was more likely to do something like this due to my ethnicity. \n\nThe charges were finally dismissed. Now what though? I lost my job, paid out hundreds of thousands that I can\u2019t recover, my name is so smeared in the media that I have severe anxiety about giving any stranger my full name, job recruiters have told me thanks but no thanks (the same people who were previously beating down my door with offers), and forget dating.

If you hear Person A has been accused of rape, even if later it's proven false, the stigma will stay with Person A and you might even say \"Well they probably did it but got away with it.\"\n\nIn American law, you are presumed innocent until proven guilty. Accusations with such life-altering consequences regardless of true guilt should be kept anonymous until it is proven true.", "I mean, absolutely. I don't really see a reason why we need to ruin the reputations of people before it can be reasonably assumed they committed a crime. \n\nI guess the negative results would be... victims being told to stay quiet?

This is practically impossible, since the case in most cases will be held before an open court where the defendant can face his accuser. Trying to suppress the identity of the defendant can lead to a less open and transparent judicial system.\n\nThe second question is whether the press should reveal the identity of the defendant. Unless there are special circumstances concerning the identity of the defendant, this seems reasonable. At the same time it's largely a moot question, since in this age of the internet and social media it doesn't really matter what the responsible, mainstream media chooses to reveal or not.", "How about a slight variation : Keep the accused's identity anonymous until a verdict is returned, whether guilty or not. That way you avoid prolonged media circuses with dribbles of information, and the public receives the entire facts - what the court decided, and the evidence they based their decision on.  And, as others have pointed out, there's no reason to treat rape differently from other crimes. ", "In my opinion every criminal should remain anonymous until proven guilty and even then i'd say it's a gray line. \n\nObviously the victim knows who it is, her/his family does and close acquaintances, but disclosing it to public press is not in my opinion okay. Regardless of his crime we should focus on rehabilitation not on punishment, for the betterment of society and the betterment of there individuals who perhaps were dealt a bad hand in life.\n\n ", "I think the bigger issue is the media. You can't guarantee an accused person anonymity during a trial, and in many cases not even in the days leading up to the trial. However, there really doesn't need to be so much aggressive character defamation by the press until the person has been proven guilty. You have every media outlet doing their best to pull a person's entire life apart and make them look like the worst person ever, just because the spotlight is on them at the moment. If they come out of it not guilty it doesn't matter, because their entire life has already been turned inside out.\n\nThat said, if they're guilty then destroy that mother fucker.", "I'm just gonna go ahead and flip the coin. In a society where you can trust that the legal system will in fact in most cases convict actual rapists, the answer to this question is obviously yes. However, at least where I'm from, the jury (which does not work the same way it does in America) more often than not lets offenders who have even admitted the crime off the hook in cases concerning rape. In one of the cases (from my own hometown) the educated judge had to step in and overturn the jury's decision because the evidence was so clear, and the rapist so dangerous, that his conscience didn't allow him to release the rapist. I can link to some cases if you want, however all the articles will be in Norwegian as I don't think they've ever made any international headlines. \n\nMy point is that yes, I do believe anonymity should be provided for a number of reasons. It's about the fundamental right to have a fair trial. However, there is also the case where rape is extremely difficult to prove. According to statistics released by the police in my country, around 20% of all rapes make it to the police, and from that statistic 5% make it to court, and from that statistic 1% ends up convicted. This is based on what's believed to be actual rapes, the ones that does happen. \n\nThere is also a separate statistic on false accusations (just to get that one out of the way), that estimates that the numbers for false accusations in relation to rape is about the same as any other criminal felony. Which means that false accusations do happen, but not more frequently in cases about rape than they do in other cases. Unfortunately a false accusation of rape can be extremely damaging to an average Jane or Joe, but it's also found that most false accusations of rape are: \n\n1. Clearly false and overstated and easy to prove wrong (and does have a 'named offender')\n2. Does not have a named offender, but is made by people with severe mental disorders and often a history of sexual abuse from childhood. \n3. The statistics show that men and women both falsely report rape just about the same amount of times within a year. \n4. The people accused in these cases are mostly men, but they rarely actually name an offender. Lose descriptions of appearance are far more common, and those descriptions are often based on stereotypes: Foreign offenders jumped someone on their way home from work, or school, or a party. \n\nNow that false accusations are out of the way, the statistics of actual rape can mean a number of things, however it absolutely means that there are number of rapists out there that have not been convicted. When someone has been let off the hook a number of times, it's also a matter of safety for the potential victims. We should find a way to solve this problem that can both give the accused of rape their anonymity, and the potential victims of actual rapists that haven't been convicted a way to stay safe. \n\nPS: The statistic is not gendered, so all statistics applies to both men and women. I'll gladly give up my sources if anyone wants them, it's just that they're all in Norwegian :P ", "100% yes. Innocent until proven guilty. In all ways and cases. ", "I believe in the notion that a person is innocent until proven guilty, to be prejudged to be guilty when they are actually innocent can ruin the lives of not only the accused but their family and friends.", "While rape trials should be a matter of public record, and there should be a public forum for honest victims to speak out on, the public should not be able to make their own presumptions of guilt or innocence before the courts do. \n\nIn the case of Audrie Pott, the young girl who committed suicide after being raped and bullied by her upperclassmen, the court of public opinion completely trashed her and her trial based solely on the identity of the rapists- members of the 'good ol boys' club who were the golden children of the high school she went to.\n\nAnd, in other cases, you see people being accused of crimes so horrendous that the massive public outrage affects the inner politics of the trial- and the outcome of the sentence.\n\nJustice only loses in those cases.\n\nPerhaps a case could be made for the public release of a suspect's identity if the suspect is on the loose, evading capture for questioning, armed and presumed dangerous, etc. But those instances are not very common.\n\nI think one of the major reasons victims don't report their sexual assaults is because they are afraid of it 'getting out' where they live. It can be painful to see your story read and judged by strangers, many of whom will shame or victim blame you.\n\nAnd there is a decent portion of the population who would presume guilt or innocence based on race  or gender. That is *super* counter-intuitive in a justice system where all defendants are to be treated equally. If you have a black man who is accused of rape, for instance, in a small rural predominantly white town, you may have an instance where the local news and talk shows bring up racist ideologies that taint the jury pool.\n\nThat works in reverse, too. People could assume because a person is rich and from a 'good (locally important) family' that there is 'no way' they accused could have done it. That also taints justice.\n\nSo, I do think the investigations of these cases should remain out of public eye, but I also believe the government should not be able to completely censor what the public knows about their justice system. Cover ups would be incredibly easy if that were the case.\n\nLet's say a judge or a politician or a 'good o boy' is accused of rape, and goes to trial for it several times. Each time they are falsely acquitted of a crime they did commit because of political favors or backdoor deals. Having no public record of that ever happening would be an affront to core United States values.\n\nBut before the trial is concluded? Absolutely not should any personal information about the alleged victims and perpetrators should come out.", "I would tend to say \"yes\", and not only to rape.

(Hell, look at Jian Ghomeshi--three women still weren't enough to secure a conviction in his case.)\n\nThe other thing you're not considering here is that there is a difference between making a public accusation and making a police report. You can't really stop someone from posting about their attacker on Twitter, unless you can prove it's *not* true.\n\nBasically if we add this additional rule we might be preventing a few false accusations, but we're also adding an additional layer of protection for *actual rapists*, and potentially gagging *actual sexual assault survivors*.

That's so important.", "Reasons why: An accusation alone can destroy someone's reputation, even if they're ultimately cleared of any wrongdoing.\n\nReasons why not: A rapist may have several victims and the first to come forward might not have strong enough evidence for a conviction, but their coming forward could encourage other victims, who may have enough evidence, to also come forward. On the flip-side of this, someone may have evidence that could exonerate the accused but without knowing they've been accused they wouldn't know to come forward. Also, I think we should have a *really fucking good* reason any time we limit freedom of speech or freedom of the press. Maybe the courts and justice system itself shouldn't publish names of the accused, but limiting what accusers and the press can say doesn't really sit well with me. So while the court may publicly label the defendant as John Doe, if the defendant or accuser or anyone connected to them outside of the justice system wants to say anything publicly, they should be free to do so.", "Here in Sweden, all the major newspapers agreed on this long ago (and it's now almost law), and as such we don't have the problem you have with innocent people being judged guilty by the court of public opinion. \n\nThe name of the convicted is released after the trial is done.\n\nHonestly can't think of anything negative that comes out of this system.", "I have this idea that every accused person should remain anonymous, even in the courtroom.

But at the same time, that anonymity could prevent other previous victims of the accused  from realising that they are not alone, having their voices heard, and potentially providing crucial evidence.\n\nGiven that criminal prosecutors generally only push for court if they think there is a reasonable chance of success, I think their anonymity should be removed once they are formally charged with the crime - to ensure the correct due process.\n\n", "As someone who was falsely accused of rape in Canada, and ultimately found not guilty in the courts (because.. you know, nothing un-consensual happened), 100%.\n\nIt destroyed my life for three years.

Anyone can be accused of any crime at any time, and an accusation of any crime with no evidence and/or proven not guilty by a court of law shouldn't have the stigma of the crime they didn't commit attached to them.

Guilty people get off scott free all the time, and innocent people suffer for crimes they didn't commit, but it *kinda* works *some* of the time, and is the best we have at the moment. Being accused of something heinous like rape or murder can completely ruin your life, tank job prospects and cause a kind of social death, no matter what the legal system decides. I don't feel that's in any way fair. \n\nWe should do all we can for the victims of violence, they should be heard, believed, and allegations investigated to the best of our abilities, but if the verdict ends up \"not guilty\" and the stigma of the allegation remains, then I don't feel like justice was actually served.

Despite the unfortunate nature of rape cases and the difficulty of obtaining smoking gun evidence, I think we really need to reign in this 'guilty until proven innocent' court of public opinion thing we have going on for a lot of rape accusations--especially on social media. It allows for accusations to be weaponized and to destroy people's lives based off of hearsay alone, and that's a scary thing. In this day and age, the accusation holds nearly as much weight as an actual conviction, and as a result people can anonymously accuse people and end their careers for sport.", "Drawback: where would it stop?

In the case of a mistake the falsely accused would still get the media attention and settlement.\n\nThere would also need to be extra care put into protecting people who accuse someone rich and powerful while at the same time not demonizing anyone.\n\nBut I  have no idea how to make those things work, especially the part about punishing only malicious false accusers without hurting anyone who honestly made a mistake. No one should ever be afraid to report a rape because they're worried about the punishment if people don't believe them. It's not something easy to fix.", "Yes.

Between the supermarket and the dorms we lived in was just row after row of suburban houses which all looked the same. As we were walking down one road we passed a field with a large camp fire and some people riding horses around it. There were people playing musical instruments, and general sounds of a good time going on - the horses and fire, and the lanterns which were dotted about, gave it a very old fashioned feel. Maybe 5 minutes after passing the field, now walking past houses again, one of my friends commented on how weird and out of place that gathering of people had been. My other friend and I had been thinking exactly the same thing so, curious, we turned around and walked back to find out exactly what was going on. There was nothing there. Not just no people or horses, there was no field; just more and more houses. Even though we were absolutely certain we were on the right road, as we'd simply turned around, we walked up and down the neighbouring roads too. We found nothing.

She used to know when I was lying, she could always sense when I was sick, even when she wasn't over, and she and I are eerily similar both in personality and looks. There are pictures of her when she was 21 and it could be me in the picture. We were very close growing up and I love her dearly. I introduced her to my now husband when we started dating in college. He is from a different country than I am and I live in his country.\n\nSo we had been dating a few years when my visa was going to expire.

My bedroom had a large fireplace that had been boarded up and painted over. I decided to push my bed up against it one day while I was rearranging things , It was like a headboard.

Where the bed pushes in and there is a warmth in your back? I felt that , So I assumed my boyfriend had come back to bed. I rolled over , my boyfriend wasn't in the bed and I felt the fucking bed release pressure , whatever was laying next to me has gotten up in that second.

She and I both felt like there was something watching and it wasn't friendly.\n\nOn this particular night, it was about midnight or so and I felt like driving to the 24/7 grocery store since I wanted some snacks.  As I stepped out the front door, I saw something out of the corner of my eye, and turned to look.\n\nThere was this very tall thing just floating, for lack of a better term (I'd almost describe it as hanging but there was nothing holding it up), outside of my brother's window.  It was seemingly covered in a sheet that had once been white, but was extremely dirty so it was more off-white, and got brown with mud and dirt the further down it went.  There were no visible feet, nor eyes or face, but I could tell it was staring at my brother's window.  As I stared at it, it turned to \"look\" at me and I remember feeling like one of those butterfly specimens, pinned to a board.  It was as though its stare was physically holding me in place.  It felt like an eternity but only a second or two passed, and it looked back at the window, the pressure lifting, and then vanished.  Right as it vanished, there was a fluttering of wings in the tree above, and one of our neighborhood's owls came to perch there.  In a way it felt like the owl came to my defense, as silly as that may sound.\n\nOur cul-de-sac loved the pair of owls, they were more like neighbors to us, so maybe it was just protective of a fellow neighbor.  That's how I like to think of it, anyway.\n\nIn any event, I decided that it might be best to just...make some popcorn or something that night instead.\n\nCome to think of it, I don't think I ever told my brother about the thing.  I probably should.", "I lived next to a facility for developmentally handicapped people for 3 years. Everyday I would jog past this historical marker on their property, one day I decided to take a break, I love history so I finally walked over and read it. \n\nIt was a dedication to a mass grave of 300 people for what used to be the grounds for a \"Hospital for the Insane\" \n\nI nearly shat my track suit.", "I had saved some spooky stuff.

My unit was at NTC for predeployment training so I met up with the rear echelon. I get issued my room and spent three very disturbed days/nights in the barracks with weird stuff happening like gear not where I left it, locked drawers being opened, the microwave turning on by itself. Shit like that. My roommate who I knew throughout training showed up on the fourth day and I told him something along the lines of, \"watch your shit. Someone's been fucking with my stuff and I don't know who.\" So the fourth night comes around and myself and my roommate secure our room and gear and go to bed. Gotta be up at 0530 for PT so it's an early night. We lock all our stuff and go to bed.\n\nI woke up around 0100 cause my blanket had fallen to the ground and I was cold which was weird cause we were in the south in summer so it's always hot. I hop down to get my blanket and I notice my armoir is open so I open the lock, close it, lock it, and get back to bed. I fell back asleep pretty easy, but I woke up again at about 0230 and all my stuff and my roommates stuff is thrown around the room. I wake up my roommate and he's pissed cause someone is fucking with us and can't figure out who it is. We clean it up lock our stuff and go back to bed. I woke up a third time at 0337 and were not alone.\n\nI can hear my roommate snoring so I know it's not him. I sat up and saw someone in the little kitchenette area with the fridge open looking in it. I was freezing again. I was about to say something as the soldier turned around. My eyes had a moment to adjust to the bright light and then I started recognizing gear like the L shaped flashlight on his shoulder, his Alice pack with magazine holders and canteens , boots and fatigues-- this dude was combat ready. As my eyes reached his face he turned a bit and I could see it. Half his head and helmet were gone. Blown off by the looks of it. I'm scared shitless at this point. He closed the fridge, walked across the room keeping his bright green eyes on, opened my front door and walked out. As he exited he turned back around and said to me, \"Be safe.\"\n\nI didn't sleep the rest of the night. I didn't wake my roommate up. I just sat up in bed for about two hours till I had to get ready for PT. 0630 rolls around so everyone is outside the barracks in formation getting ready to start PT and the acting First Sergeant says, \"Hey, notchase, you good? Looks like you seent a ghost.\" I replied with, \"Negative, I'm fine, 1SG good to go.\" About half way through PT he comes up to me and asks me what's wrong because I'm visibly shaken up. I told him I was fine just couldn't sleep last night. A few others asked if I was ok and I just lied and said I was fine. I really wasn't and they could see that but they let me be.\n\nAfter PT ended the acting 1SG pulled me to the side and told me to, \"speak freely, openly, and with all confidentiality and off the record: What is wrong?\" I told him that if I told him what happened he would think I'm batshit crazy. He assured me it was off record and once again said, \"Talk to me. You seriously look like you've seen a ghost.\" That got an awkward chuckle out of me and I began to tell him my story and when I got to the part about his head the acting 1SG LOST HIS SHIT.. \"who the fuck put you up to this?\" \"This is NOT funny\" etc etc. he smoked me for about 30 minutes (made me do push-ups, mountain climbers, stuff like that) all while yelling at me that I'm a piece of shit. Finally after about 30 minutes of that he says, \"look at me in the eye and swear on everything that you love that you're not lying to me.\" I told him I was not lying. It fuckin happened. So he says follow me so I do.\n\nWe get to the command office which I had never been in and they were obviously locked. He takes me behind three locked doors and three rooms I had never stepped foot in and when he opened the last door I saw it. It gave me chills. It still gives me chills, but plain as day there's the soldier's portrait behind the commanders desk. I froze and said, \"that's him.\" Acting 1SG, the guy who assigned me that room, told me who it was. He was a Corporal in the unit on my units first deployment to Iraq and he died in an IED attack that took off part of his head. I was the first soldier to be assigned that room since it belonged to the deceased corporal.\n\nHe forgave me and I forgave him and he told me some stories about who this guy was. I deployed with that unit just a couple months later and spent 12 months fighting in that shithole. I nearly died I don't know how many times, my vehicle got hit with IEDs and rockets and it always made me think of that corporal. I survived more things than most people can image and I always felt like that corporal was keeping an eye out for me. Not everyone in my unit was as lucky as me. 3 from my company didn't get to come home.\"\n\n\n", "About 2 months after my father passed my Mom and all of my brothers and sisters were sitting around the dining room table. We were just talking about the past and sharing stories. We were talking about my father and suddenly the globe around the light on the ceiling fell straight down on the center of the table. It didn't break or roll or move at all after hitting the table. Scared the shit out of all of us. ", "Freshman year at my university.  We had a creepy, old dorm on campus that no-one was living in.  Everyone generally avoided it because it just had an uncomfortable feeling when you got close to it and felt like you were being watched.  There are rumored stories about it of two women dying there on separate occasions (one murder, one suicide) and they're the ones who haunt the building.\n\nOne night, a friend was in a bad mood because his girlfriend had broken up with him, so I was walking around campus with him to let him get it off his chest and just trying to help him feel better.  We walked past the dorm and I brought it up about it being haunted and was telling him the stories to try and take his mind off it.  So, the way the bottom floor was setup, there were two doors on both sides of the building and the hallway ran the entire length of the building and you could see the other door.  We walked up to one of the windows and were just looking down the hall when two girls walked out of a room, wearing clothes that looked like they were from the 70s/80s and stood there in the hall looking at each other, not speaking...\n\nThen, one girl slowly turned her head and looked straight at us, slowly turned her head back, then turned and walked the opposite way from us down the hall.  So we ran to the other side of the building, but we couldn't find them.  We came back to the original door....and watched them do the same thing all over again.  We looked at each other and ran.\n\nThis freaked me out for a while, especially after, when I was sleeping in my room and all my posters fell off the wall at the same time.\n\nAfter telling this story to another friend, he convinced me to go back with him and try to find a way in.  We found an open window (which we later found out was the room the girl hung herself in) and climbed in and started walking down the hall.  We wandered around the building a bit and just started to notice generally creepy things....water faucets started coming on, we'd walk through one room and then back through and a chair would be moved...on the first floor, a desk was turned upside down under the stairwell...as we we're getting close to leaving, a lot more water faucets came on and kept getting louder and louder...then when we got back to the room to go back out of the window, and as we put our hands on the window, the door slammed closed...so we ripped the door open, dove out and ran back to our dorm...and never went back.", "Mine is a bit different;\n\nMe and friend of mine live in Rural Ireland, we were going for a walk in the grounds behind a castle.  As we were coming to the end of our walk, it was pretty dark and we glanced into an area that has a well and something caught our eyes.  I (he stayed a bit further back) walked over and looked into the well only to see two yellow eyes looking up at me and a sinister looking grin from a girl with dark hair, naturally we ran like little girls.\n\nWe were followed by this little girl all night, we went to grave yard and found her watching us while she sat on a tree.  We went under a bridge a few miles outside of the village and she was standing at the other end of the bridge, and slowly started walking toward us.  We both saw her every single time.\n\nExplanation is easy; we dropped a shit load of LSD and were hallucinating.  Just fascinating that we both saw the exact same thing.  I never told him what I saw in the well until he told me what he had seen, it matched. ", "I have a bunch but I think the best one I have actually happened to my mom. We lived in a very creepy very old house when I was little. One day my mom was cleaning my little brother's room while we were at school and every single one of his electronic toys turned on all at once.\n\nTwo of them did not have batteries in them.\n\nShe was so freaked out she had us \"camp out\" in the living room for three days cause she didn't want my brother alone in his room.\n\nUp until we moved, that would occasionally happen. Either one or two toys at a time.", "At the time I was around 14, I\u2019d asked my dad to wake me up early that morning at about 5am because I had some work to get done. That morning, I was woken up, and I flung my legs over the side of my bed. I felt a tug on both of them, what I thought at the time was just my dad trying to get me to hurry up, I reached over to pick up my phone and turned it on, 3:30 am, and I looked over at the black figure I assumed was my dad and it was gone.", "My high school used to be a giant mansion before it was converted into an orphanage and then a high school. One section of the school, \"the third floor,\" was inaccessible. The staircase which lead to the floor was blocked off with wood and painted black to match the chorus room where it was located. In 2003, during the fall school show of Les Miz, they had to remove the wood so they could replace the windows on that third floor. We even ended up using some of the removed windows for our barricade. \n\nWe had play practice most nights and, if you lived far enough away, usually you would just stay at the school and wait rather then go home just to come right back up. While waiting for practice to start one night, myself and 3 friends Ryan, Mike and Michele, decided to go up the staircase to check out the third floor. The staircase was rotted and falling apart from years of disuse so we carefully went up one at a time to find......an unremarkable hallway with some even less remarkable rooms off to the sides. All of this lead into a big open area with old, stacked desks and folders full of test papers from like the 80's or something. \n\nThe four of us were a bit disappointed because the rumor was that this section of the school was not converted from the orphanage that occupied the space several decades earlier and the ghosts of orphans still haunted the place. Since we didn't get spooked, we ended up just digging through the old papers. While Michele was looking through the papers in a side room with her back to us, Ryan pushed Mike and myself out of the room quietly and into an adjacent room to scare Michele into thinking we disappeared. Sure enough, she comes bolting out of the room screaming at us, throwing out \"fuck you guys\" and \"this isn't funny.\" We had to muffle our mouths to keep from laughing, when, all of a sudden, one of the people in the room fucking ruined the whole thing by giggling like a little girl. I turned to Ryan and Mike to see which one of them ruined the joke but both of their hands were over their mouths and their eyes were wide as dinner plates. This room we were in, hiding behind the door, was small; maybe the side of a small, one-stall bathroom (maybe thats what it was once upon a time) and somebody **in this god damn tiny room was giggling and it was none of us.** \n\nThis whole plot played out in probably like 10 seconds between leaving Michelle and hearing the giggle. So we stood there staring at each other waiting for something to happen that explained this. It was like 4 or 5 pm and we were the only ones in the Chorus Classroom the entire day. We would have seen someone go upstairs. We would have heard the stairs creaking as they went up there. Whoever giggled at us from inside that room was up there already. Unfortunately, we didn't get the explanation we needed because a second set of giggles started happening, this time more than one person making them. That was it for Ryan, a big, tough former athlete-turned-show-kid, who screamed the highest pitch scream I've ever seen a guy that size make (it would have been funny if we weren't terrified.) He pushed past us, ran screaming out into the hallway, scared the daylights out of Michele on his way down and we bolted down the steps. This time, we did not take them one by one and actual chunks of rotted wood started falling off. We explained what happened to Michele and then went somewhere that was not the Chrous Classroom until play practice started. \n\nThe maintenance team must have known we were up because we all collectively got a talking to about going up there. Safety concerns with the rotted steps. So of course, people started going up there willy nilly hoping to see a ghost. There are more stories about that third floor during that year that promptly stopped once they replaced the windows and sealed the room back up. Now the school is closed and empty so whatever ghosts were having a good time are now free to do so without the living getting in the way. \n\nEDIT: Sorry this is much longer than it seemed when I posted. **TL;DR** - ghost orphans at my high school think pranks are funny. ", "When I was about 12 I was at my cousin's house (he was about 9) fucking around on their trampoline. This was an older neighborhood, kind of dilapidated. My cousin and I get the bright idea to sneak into the old abandoned house on the other side of his fence. So we climb the fence, walk the narrow path between his fence and the side of the old house (we were barefoot, wtf) and go around to the front of the house. \n\nThe front door was actually modern, a steel door with a lock on it. We tried it, and it opened. We went inside and the smell hit us like a wall. This sweet, sickly smell filled the whole house, so we held our noses as we walked through. There was no glass on the floor, which was fortunate for our aforementioned bare feet, but there was a lot of dust. It was a shotgun house with maybe four small rooms that we could tell, and in the front room there were like 6 or 7 mountain bikes. We figured someone was just storing things here. The bathroom was off this room, and it had a bunch of small, old glass bottles that looked like they dated back to the 1940s or thereabouts. \n\nThe second room, past the first, had a bunch of old junk in it but the thing that sticks out in my mind was an old cassette player with a cassette still in it. On the label the cassette said \"Deborah, March 18, 1993.\" We didn't really care about this. \n\nThe third room had more bikes and more junk, and it had a tiny closet off to the side. We wrestled the cobwebs away and saw nothing other than a fucking chainsaw with red-brown residue on it. Alarm bells were going off in our heads now, and even though we tried to rationalize it as just rust, we decided to quickly see what was in the fourth room and then GTFO. \n\nWe walked into the fourth room and saw that it was completely empty, except for some stairs to the basement, lots of dust, and a small wooden cross. Painted on it were these words: \"Deborah- September 29, 1963, - March 18, 1993.\" Then we heard a thump from the basement.\n\nThen we ran. We ran out the front door, down the path, climbed the fence, through my cousin's backyard, into his house, up the stairs, into his room and under the bed. We stayed there for hours, whispering and speculating and vowing never to go back there again. But we did. And that's another story for another day.\n\nYou might think this is fictional, and I kinda worded it that way. But I can't make this up.", "One time I wanted a Coke and when I went into the kitchen there was, I shit you not, a knife balancing on its tip.  Next to a full can of Coke.  When I was home alone.\n\nEdit: Holy crud this has gotten a lot of attention!  To answer a few questions, yes, I drank the soda.  To the skeptics who say I'm lying: This happened.  If you don't believe, give me a rational explanation as to how a soda can get from a refrigerator to the kitchen counter, along with a knife standing on its tip, which might be impossible.

My sister was away at school 7 hours away and neither of my parents were going to be home for another 5 hours at minimum. I ran in, changed my clothes, grabbed my tires then drove to a garage to get them installed. I got home 2 hours later and as I walked into the living room, there was a chair just sitting in the middle of the hallway and was facing the front door. I thought nothing of it but didn't recognize the chair as being one that we owned. It was a standard metal folding chair that you would buy for a couple bucks at a retail store. I folded it up and propped it up against my dads work bench in our garage. My mom gets home a couple hours later and I ask her in passing why she left a metal chair in the middle of the hallway. She tells me we don't own any metal chairs and that she hadn't been home up until an hour ago. I told her I came home and there was a metal chair just sitting in the middle of the hallway after I had gotten back from the garage. She told me to show her the chair and when I went out to the garage to show it to her, it was gone. I looked high and low for that metal chair but couldn't find it. I swore to her that I wasn't on drugs and that I wasn't imagining things. She thought what I was telling her was strange but didn't pay much attention to it.

The place was built in 1900, so it was just over 100 years old when I moved in. The living room and kitchen were fine, but the bathroom and bedroom we're unnerving, like I just always felt like I was being watched, especially in the bedroom if the closet door was open. Those unnerving feelings just became moderately uncomfortable as I settled in. I felt safe in the bedroom, but only if the door was locked. One night I was dead asleep when there was a loud BANG on my bedroom door. When I got up the courage to get out of bed, I checked the apartment and all the windows were closed and locked from the inside, the door still had the chain secured, no one was in there. I mentioned the closet in the bedroom, I never liked going in there, and I never liked if the door was open. For some reason, in my head I would hear gasping noises. So for that reason, the closet stayed closed.\n\nA month or more after I was woken to the bang on my door, I was dead asleep. But something woke me up, and it was a pressure on me like being held down. It was pitch black in my room, I couldn't see anything, but I knew some was standing over me. When I could finally turn on a bedside lamp no one was there. After then I couldn't sleep in the dark, I had to sleep with a lamp on. That incident scared the life out of me. And after that the unnerving feeling of being watched intensified. Friends would come over, and comment about being uncomfortable in the bathroom like being watched. It became so uncomfortable for me, when I had the chance to move to another unit, I jumped at it. I packed up and got out.\n\nAfter me, several people rented the apartment, and they would move out within months. I became friendly with the building manager, and I told him that I felt the place was haunted. He kind of laughed it off.\n\nYears after, they were renovating the place, building manager was doing some painting in there, the building owner was there too. I went and checked out the apartment, and it looked nicer, it didn't feel as creepy. I got to talking with the building owner, and through the course of conversation he just throws it out there that a former tenant committed suicide in the closet by hanging themselves. He also mentioned that the original designer of the building lived in that apartment, and died in there.

I would have it at least twice a year, always the same even though I would realize I was dreaming after the first few iterations.\n\n>I would fall asleep and dream of being in a cave and going into this little hole in the bottom. Inside I would see a 10-15 foot long corridor about 2-4 feet high. At the end it would always turn left, and I always saw a bent red stop sign at the end, like someone ripped off the top 2 feet and tossed it in. But I would always follow the corridor. \n\n>I would turn and walk past the sign despite being scared, despite many times knowing what was there, and the corridor would start descending, quickly opening up into a large vertical chamber with the path leading down in a corkscrew.

Every time. And I could never do anything.\n\n>After I saw that, I would be stuck for a few seconds until I felt more than saw everything turn and look at me. And I would wake up.

I went down with my brother while my father waited up at the top. There was a hole in the ground. I started to feel uneasy though I didn't know why. So I followed my brother into the hole. I felt worse as I moved down. \n\n>And when I looked up I saw the same corridor, the same turn, the same wall, the same bottles at the corner. And I instantly was hit with this overwhelming sense of nausea and fear and being watched and everything was screaming at me to leave. \n\n>I froze and must have made some noise because my brother turned around and asked what was wrong. I managed to say I wanted to leave now and climbed out as quickly as I could, followed immediately by my brother.\n\n>We packed up and left, never have gone back and never will. Haven't told anyone what actually happened, just said I wasn't feeling well, and they forgot pretty quickly. \n\n>The thing that really makes it creepy for me is I have never had the dream again.

I was taking a nap around 11 am on the couch in their living room with the TV on when I was woken up by a door knob jiggling hard upstairs. Their doors have those knobs that lock by pushing in the knob and turning, no buttons or anything on it. I assumed that my dad had locked himself in a room accidentally, as he had done it before to great comedic effect and frustration on his part.  \n\nSo I go upstairs, and all the doors are wide open. At this point I was a little weirded out, but I decided I was have some weird half awake imaginary sound thing going on. I go back downstairs and turn the TV off and fall back asleep. About an hour later I'm woken up again by the sound of a door knob jiggling, except it was on the other side of the house upstairs from the last one. I go up again and all the doors are still wide open. I called my parents at work (they ran an automobile service station at the time), and asked if either of them had been home at all that day, and both said that they were at work all day. Needless to say I got the fuck out of there. It hasn't happened since, and that was about 6 years ago.\n\nAlso related, a friend and I were helping my parents move into that house, and moving a bunch of stuff into a room above the attached garage.

There was a small closet attached to the room and when my friend and I were moving things into there, we noticed that there was a book case sitting in there with a note saying that we could keep it. That's when we noticed that there was the top of a doorway behind the book case. Again, super creeped out. Eventually we got around to checking that door out and it just led to the attic and nothing was in there, but at the time it was super creepy and weird.", "I got lost in the woods in North Carolina during a game of paintball. It was broad daylight, but the woods were really thick and every tree looked exactly the same. It probably only lasted 1-2 minutes, but it felt like I was screaming \"help\" for hours.\n\nThe worst part? Turns out I wasn't even lost. I was maybe 10 feet from everyone else, and they all heard me screaming \"help,\" but they thought I was acting as a decoy... Like what the actual fuck?! Who hears someone crying for help and ignores them?! Jesus, dad!!", "I'm sure this will get buried, but I've got one. It's more bittersweet spooky than spooky spooky, but here goes - my ex had this lamp that she had on the island in our kitchen. She turned it on pretty much every night and in the mornings to make coffee it was a pretty solid little lamp. I brought my cat to live with us late in our relationship because she had dogs and my cat was pretty up there in age and not used to dogs, so I tried to spare her little heart from that shock. She came to love laying down in the spot by where that lamp plugged into an outlet on the wall of the island. She died soon after I brought her over, and I was absolutely heartbroken. I had a hard time accepting the loss. About a week after my cat died, my ex was grinding coffee in a little electric grinder and I heard her shriek from the other room. I rushed over to see what was going on, and she told me she felt something cold pass by her feet, then the light on the lamp started flickering. She tried to show me again the flickering, but it didn't happen. I just chalked it up to her being weird at 6AM. A couple of days later, she asked me to make coffee for her. I grab the grinder, flick on the lamp to see what I was doing, and sure enough the same thing happened to me - a cold wind whipped past me like a cat running around my feet, then the light on the lamp flickered before I could even get the grinder going. It never happened before or after, despite the hundreds of times I'd used that grinder in the same outlet as the lamp. I like to think it was my little girl saying goodbye one last time.", "Okay why the fuck did I read this thread at 5 AM before going to bed? ", "So I'm 17 and I was working at my great grans house. She's really old, and is called Constance. Hasn't walked in years (just turned 100 years old and spends all day lying in bed). I often go visit her, in this old school house that she has lived in for around 60 years. It's got an amazing view of the river, from her bedroom you get one of the best views in the whole town. Not that she can see any of it, because she's almost completely blind. She always has these stories. About how all the children from the school would play out in her front garden. She's also told me that men had been in her house at night, and tortured her, but that's unrelated. Anyways.\n\nI'm visiting her one morning and I ask if there's any jobs needing done around her house. She tells me that I should check the garden and do some tidying up around there. So I go out the house, and inspect. Now next to her porch (where everyone goes in) is a really narrow pathway. It's just between the house and this embankment. So I look down it (it appears to be a little path leading to nowhere) and notice there's loads of leaves needing cleared. Above the path is just branches and greenery. So I go inside get a rake, put on gloves and head in. It's only 10 meters but as I'm going down I notice the path seems to vear behind the house. I follow it round, into this incredibly strange 5 x 5 foot ish open space. There appears to be no other way to get to this 5 x 5 square, but I notice there's this door. It's built into the side of the wall, NOT her house. It's covered in bracken (Scottish word for Ferns) and so I pull some of it back. It appears the door has something written on it. So I clear everything out the way and move back to inspect. There's clearly \"games room\" printed into it. Now that made sense to me, because it was a school right? But then I notice this door has a padlock on it. The padlock seems sturdy, even though the metal it's attached to looks ancient. I try it and it won't budge, but notice theres a little whole in the door. I put my iPhone torch on to try see in, but its got what appears to be another layer of wood behind it.\n\nSo I head back. I go up to the room, and asked her. about this little room in the back. I show her the photo (that I still have) and she doesn't recognise it. Probably because she's practically blind. All she says is \"no, the games room was down under the stairs by the door. There was 2 rooms out back, but they were just storage. I don't remember there ever being a games room out back\" So I ask her where these rooms were. She tells me their up on the embankment, also built into the wall. So I go back out. I climb up (using the side of the house and the wall of the embankment, like some shit outta spider-man) and manage to find these two wood cellar door type things. So I go over and notice that the locks are incredibly rusty. I could literally just pull them off. So I do. Now my gran was right. It was just an old storage room. I open it up, and it's empty. Some old fabric type material on the ground, that appears to be all.\n\nSo I ask my grandparents (Constance's daughter). She does not know anything about these room, despite growing up in the house, and literally just told me. I ask her to come up and take a look, so she does. We go through the same process ( only much longer to climb up) and when we arrive at the doors built into the wall her only remark was \"oh. Peculiar. Best go in see grandma because we will need to bring you home soon.\"\n\nStill spooks me out thinking about how this tiny little bolted room n the wall is so detached from society. My great gran didn't remember it existing, and my gran appeared to have no interest. Nobody would see this from anywhere else (this little 5x5 patio thing is there, on the other side of the wall is just a big hill which I assume the room was built into). Above it is completely covered in branches and leaves.\n\nIf anyone actually reads this and feels like they wanna see pics I can post them.", "First I'd like to preface this story by saying that I consider myself a pretty rational person. I understand intrinsically that there has to be *some* explanation for it, but I don't know what it is. Ok.\n\nWhen I was eleven I went to a summer camp type place with my classroom for four days. I don't remember the name, but I do remember that everyone of the kids had immediate weird vibes when we got there. Lots of kids waking up crying wanting to go home, meltdowns, general not fun when it should of been fun. Kids wandering off into the woods. Camp counselors miserable. \n\nOne night I woke up to the sound of tapping on the window. At first I thought it was just a branch or something but the tapping followed a rythym. It went tap-taptap-taptaptap-taptap. Once I figured out that it wasn't random I got more scared then I've ever been in my life. Were we being pranked by another cabin? I ran into the nook our counselor slept in and started to wake him up. The clock next to him was deep into early morning, maybe three AM. He woke up and got mad at me, telling me to go back to bed. I understood that it wasn't a prank at that point. I went and laid in my bed. Soon after it started again. Eventually it stopped. I was terrified and didn't go back to sleep. \n\nThe next day shit was weird. It's normal for kids to be scared, but I was caught on some questioning my own morality type shit. I refused to go canoeing cause I was cnvinced we would die. If I was near the woods I was overcome with a desire to walk deep into them and that terrified me more. This wasnt normal little kid scared shit, this was a deep existential acceptance of the possibility of my own death, and I feel like 11 is kinda young for that, but maybe not. \n\nThe whole trip I couldn't hang. Even on the school bus back I was convinced something would happen to the bus. I didn't feel normal for weeks. Everyone I talked to about it denied it, they were sleeping, the other cabins had no clue, there was no pranking going on to corroborate the possibility of that being it. \n\nIt had to be something rational but for the life of me I don't know what it is. The space next to the window was free of branches. Maybe it was a deer? Who knows.", "When I was in high school me, my grandmother, grandfather, and my friend all saw this pale girl with black hollow eyes in their house. \n\nMy grandmother stayed up late all the time on her computer. She heard some foot steps that eventually came into her room. Thinking it was me, she turned around and said \"what's up, katze69\"\nNope. It was the girl looking at her. \n\nI saw her through the glass shower door while I was showering (scared the shit out of me)\n\nAnd my friend saw her at the top of the basement stairs while she was in the fridge getting some water. She told me about it, I asked her to describe, it was the girl with black hollow eyes. \n\nMy grandma later had dreamt of her. She dreamt there was a well in her backyard about 100 years ago and in the dream the girl fell down the well. She said during her dream she felt extreme sorrow and anxiety. She said our house wasn't there, but in the dream she knew she was in the land her house was. \n\nIt was all weird. I don't necessarily believe in ghosts. Just weird things happen. ", "I went to use the bathroom at work and when I entered, there was no one in there. The bathroom has 4 urinals and 4 stalls (one handicap), and I did not see any feet in any of the stalls. I took up my normal spot inside one stall and was doing my business, when I heard the sound of someone peeing into one of the urinals....but no one had entered the bathroom. The door is heavy and loud when it closes, so I would've heard someone entering. After a normal amount of time, the peeing stop, and I heard a few footsteps. But the door never opened. When I finished up I did a cursory look and there was no one in the bathroom.\n\nIt's a ridiculous story, but I definitely heard a pee ghost.", "Sorry if its not that creepy but its the best I got. It happened last year at camp when a friend and I decided to go to the bathroom at 3am in the morning to charge our phones (there was only two workin outlets in the barracks and one of them was in the bathroom) so we're in there and we heard the something like a doorknob turning so we start lookin around for the source and we noticed it was coming from the door leading out the bathroom. Now your first thought was it was just somebody pulling a prank on us but it would be impossible to walk that close to the door without hearing the loud creak that you can hear everytime you step wood planks in that hallway and when I sey loud I mean you cpuld hear it thru out the whole building loud not enough to wake you up but it was loud enough. The weirdest part is that we moved looked out into the hallway and saw nobody there and you would have most defiantly heard them if they was running across the floor and noway someone could be that fast without making a sound. Too sum it up it wasn't really spooky but most defiantly odd since we heard alot of weird happenings at that camp like how one of the other barracks had all of their shoes put into the bathroom without anybody noticing then again that could have been easily fake. Anyways sorry if its boring but its probably the spookiest thing I could think of off the top of my head.", "I posted this in a local \"hauntings\" group on Facebook a few months ago, so I'll copy paste. I live in an area that has a lot of native history and originally typed it up after another member in the group posted his experiences as a security guard in the same living complex. I never had \"paranormal\" experiences until living in this apartment.\n\nMy dad bought a condo on the ground floor of a large 2 tower condo complex in the mid-2000s and did an absolutely beautiful renovation. After his divorce, he rented it out for several years. He had bad luck over and over with tenants would not stay more than a couple months and repeatedly did not pay rent. In fall of 2008 I moved in and rented the second bedroom to young woman.\n\nVisiting my dad when he and my stepmom still lived there, I never spent enough time to really notice anything nor was my brain attuned to the paranormal. Even after the renovation, the condo had a dark, creepy vibe which I never thought much of and attributed to being on the ground floor with lots of trees and a stream outside.\n\nFor exactly a year from fall 2008-09, I didn\u2019t experience much. I later asked the roommate who lived there (about 3 months) if she had any experiences and she said she always felt that she was being watched, particularly \u201cfrom the stream\u201d. There were 3 seemingly insignificant things that happened during this year that made me for a moment wonder if the apartment was haunted, but I never put much thought into it at the time.\n\nThe first was the fan. I lived in the master bedroom with a small office area attached where I kept the cat litter box. There was a ceiling fan in there with the wall switch that let you select off/low/med/high. Every time I would turn it off, it would go on high. Or I\u2019d turn it on medium and it would go off. Easy to chalk up to faulty electrical wiring, so I never put much thought into it. The second incident during that time was a little more frightening, but brushoffable. I was in a long distance relationship at the time. One night as I was falling asleep, in that zone between wakefulness and dreamland, I heard my name called from a very specific spot on the ceiling in a disembodied version of my boyfriend\u2019s exact voice. Jerked me awake saying WTF, but I didn\u2019t lose too much sleep.\n\nThe third odd thing that happened in the apartment can easily be explained as a plumbing disaster. For that year I pretty much only used the \"green bathroom\" in the hallway (the master bath creeped me out). I came home one day to bad flooding from the toilet that was restricted to only the bathroom. The insurance guys came, ripped up all the wood flooring from the main door to all of the master bedroom (somehow leaving the bathroom tile intact), determined there was absolutely no way the plumbing could have malfunctioned and refused to replace anything, leaving a $10k job to my dad out of pocket after destroying the house. This has always been a bit of a headscratcher and just added to the oddness and weirdness of this place. My dad never replaced the flooring and I walked on concrete the rest of my time there. After the flooding, for the rest of my time there, the green bathroom was really humid and warm, musty smelling (this will be important later). I still used that bathroom but not as much.\n\nFast forward a year. Long distance guy and I break up. Life goes on during this time. No more incidents that I can recall in the apartment. One important person to this story was a security guard. I\u2019ll call her Pam. She knew us from growing up there and was always friendly when I drove in and out. In Fall of 2009 I was dating a new guy named Matt who had just moved from California, a nice, good, positive dude. I'm not super woo woo, but I think most of us can agree that everything in life is some sort of energy and spirits/paranormal is the best example of that. Adding or subtracting people (energies) or drastically changing an environment such as renovating can throw off the balance of energy. When Matt moved in is when shit started getting weird.\n\nOctober of 2009. I remember this night like it happened yesterday. I borrowed my dad\u2019s car for the night and needed to register it with security. Pam was working. She was making small talk as she was filling out the form, not looking at me, and casually asked \u201cDid you get your place cleansed yet?\u201d\nGut punch to my stomach. Everything flooded into my head at once and I KNEW. I started shaking and asked \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\nShe looked up at me and said \u201cWhen you moved in I told you to get that place cleansed.\u201d\nI said \u201cI probably thought you said cleaned\u2026\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said \u201cCLEANSED. Spiritually.\u201d\nI flipped the f out. I burst into tears. Everything I knew deep down and never acknowledged about this apartment was true. I refused to go back into the apartment that night and asked Matt to get me overnight stuff to stay at my mom\u2019s.\nIt turned out that Pam was wiccan and offered to do a full cleansing of the apartment the next night. So the next night rolls around. Pam, me (armed with bags of sage), Matt, and two new people: Tiffany, a girl who had lived in the same apartment growing up (apparently my dad bought it when her dad sold it) and was now into semi-professional ghost hunting due to her experiences in that apartment growing up (WTF!!!), and her girlfriend. Tina had an EMF(?) device that registers supernatural activity and a recording device, which we placed on the coffee table in the enclosed patio. Pam led us through the house, we repeated what she said, asking any negative spirits to leave, etc. Nothing odd happened, they left, and Matt and I went to bed. Good to go. Right?\n\nA few days later Pam called me. \u201cTiffany caught something on the recording.\u201d I met Tiffany in the lobby (she now lived in the other tower in the complex, in a different, less haunted apartment). She played the recorder from the night of the cleansing. You can hear Pam chanting/leading us starting from the kitchen and us repeating. As we slowly walked through the enclosed patio and past the coffee table with the recorder on it, a woman\u2019s voice screams directly into the recorder \u201cGET OUT\u201d.\n\nFrom here on out is where my timeline starts to shuffle, because it\u2019s not really relevant nor do I remember in what order everything happened unless otherwise noted. Stuff happened on a daily basis. I wish I\u2019d written it all down at the time, but I didn\u2019t. We did 8 or 10 cleansings over the year with little change. This is all what I remember off my head. There was a period of about 3-4 months where things got so bad that I took my cat and moved to my mom\u2019s house. She\u2019d already heard the recordings that I\u2019d borrowed from Tiffany and let me stay. During this time, Tiffany and I set up the recorder on the counter over the washer/dryer to see if we could catch anything while I was away. We did. It\u2019s important to note here that I was the only person who had a key. Neither the resident manager or even my dad had a key. I remember this specifically because I had to call a locksmith one day when I locked myself out. Anyway, the recording. A ghost family was living in the house. Sounded like they were possibly from the 40s/50s era. We caught about 8 distinct voices on the recording: A woman who liked to sing, a woman with yippie chihuahua-like dogs (no dogs near me in the apartments), a woman who was chronically coughing (tuburculosis?), a little boy who ran up and down the hallway, a man speaking in the local dialect and doing laundry, people cooking, talking about mundane life stuff. The coughing lady would repeatedly speak directly into the recorder, softly saying \u201chelp me, help me.\u201d This went on for weeks.\n\n(Continued in comments)", "When I was about 10, four of our cousins lived with us, and I had two siblings so that means there were seven of us. We were in the family room sitting in a circle playing a game. My parents were out doing whatever adult errands they had that day. We all heard a voice call out \"Zachary!\" It was the voice of our grandmother (and one of my cousins was named Zach). No one heard my parents come home and they didn't mention they would be getting our grandma so we all ran out of the room to greet her. We quickly realized my parents were not home, and our grandmother wasn't there either. We even went outside to check and there was no one in our neighbors yards either. We were baffled.

It was pitch black as there were low-level clouds blocking the moon.\n\nAll of a sudden, I see a HUGE orange flash and vividly remember it lighting the bottom of the clouds, meaning it came from the ground. About 5 seconds later there was a big boom. We head over that direction, expecting there to be a train fire or something, but find nothing and turn back. \n\nOnce we got to her driveway, we saw it again.

This happened maybe three years ago, I usually lucid dream before. I took a nap at around 4 in the afternoon and my room is dark. I started feeling something heavy and I cant move, I realized that I was lucid dreaming again, then all of a sudden my room was filled with dark shadows, taking turns looking at me while I lay down praying and desperately trying to move, then there is this one shadow that touched me and turned my face side to side as if inspecting if I am awake or alive at that moment I became very scared and I did my best to stand up. Guess what? I was able to sit up on my bed but when I looked at my right side I saw myself lying down and all the dark shadows suddenly swarm around my bed. I tried to lie down again and pray and did my best to move. Then I woke up.", "This isn't the crazy ghost-story stuff that other folks have posted, but to this day this gives me chills:\n\nEarly Sophomore year in college my girlfriend spends the night in my dorm room. She'd lost her virginity to me the night before and this was her first time ever spending the night in a boy's bed.\n\nThat morning, she's still half-asleep so I get into the shower. While showering I'm 100% certain I can hear someone calling out my name. But hey, I ignored it - there's that thing were you end up hearing your own name in white noise just b/c it's something you're so attuned to hear.\n\nThe weird thing was it sounded very loud (like it was being shouted) but also very, very far away but also like the sound was coming from deep inside my own head. Like I was wearing headphones and hearing my own name called out in this tiny, tiny, panicked scream.\n\nIt was really odd, but again I dismissed it entirely. Finished my shower and went about my day, never mentioning it to anyone.\n\nTwo years later - we're sitting around in someone's dorm room and my girlfriend casually mentions, \"Oh yeah, remember that first night I stayed in your room? And then you went to go to the shower? I was freaking out because it was so dark in your room and I started having a panic attack and started screaming your name in my head while you were in the shower.\"\n\nI try not to think about this too much, since I'm very much one of those \"science uber alles\" types of guys who likes to mock new age crap.

I was camping with my grandparents who had this old motorhome from the 70s which already had a sort of spooky vibe to it. My grandma had bought me a book (can't remember the name) but it was on the history of demons. In the opening pages it talked about how demons try to influence and scare people and how, while they may be interesting, they should never be our sole focus of study when it comes to the supernatural. The book talked about how demons are always on alert trying to look for ways to influence you if you open your mind to them. I remember the book recommended praying for spiritual protection before delving too deep into demonic lore. I also remember thinking that seemed ridiculous, as if demons (if they even existed) would care about me reading some stupid book. Just as I finished telling my grandmother how silly that all seemed this old-time radio in the motorhome turned on and started scanning through the diffferent radio stations before settling on some old religious guy who was preaching, interestingly enough, on hellfire and brimstone. \n\nWe both immediately got goosebumps and just stared at eachother before she went over and turned the radio off. We spent a lot of years camping in the old motorhome and that was the only time that something like that happened. ", "So once my spouse and I visited a town for three days, we stayed in an Airbnb flat. The flat owner seemed a little weird, never smiled, never looked at us in the eyes. He showed us the main room and then he opened a door in the corridor to show a smaller room. He said the room was \"not in use\" and we should not go there.\n\nIt was not you old creepy flat by any accounts, it was renovated, full of light, and the furniture was new. However, it had a super weird vibe. The first evening of the two we stayed, my spouse woke up very scared in the middle of the night, saying there was something at the other side of the door. I told them it was a nightmare, but they kept repeating there was \"something\" (they do not believe in the supernatural at all). I checked, there was nothing, and to calm them down I locked the bedroom door with a chair. That night I had a super odd nightmare, in which an unseen thing was stalking me into a warehouse, Silent Hill style.\nDuring these three days, whenever I checked the unused bedroom, the light was on and the door was open. I closed it every time, blaming my partner's absent-mindedness.\n\nThe second night we came home late, and my partner, who left the town earlier than I did, started packing their luggage. Suddenly, they started bleeding from a deep cut in the hand. We cleaned and bandaged the wound (it bled profusely, like all injuries in the hand do), and looked for the sharp object or razor that did it. We did not find anything, and to date we still don't know how they got the cut.\nThat night I had a nightmare again.\n\nThe last morning I had a couple hours on my own before my train left, so I was packing my stuff. When I looked at the unused bedroom, the light was on and the door was open. I switched the light off and closed the door.\n\nFive minutes later, the light was on again and the door was open.\n\nI repeated the action, but when I looked again the light was still on and the door was open. So I thought, \"it must be something with the electricity cables, and if not it is a ghost that wants the light on, I am not gonna touch it\". When I looked again, the light was off.\n\nI am not sure what was going on in there but in that moment I fucked off, grabbed the carton of milk and cookies I had and had breakfast in the park. My spouse asked the owner about the lights in the unused room, but the guy never replied.\n\nAnyway this is my creepy experience. My partner's cut was almost five millimeters deep and two centimeters long. They almost needed stitches. As we said, we don't believe in ghosts but like fuck we are repeating the experience.

People go there for skiing and hiking. It wasn\u2019t winter, so we were there to do some easy hiking (my sister and I were quite young, I was about 11), and to stay for a couple of nights.\n\nI can\u2019t remember the name of the hotel we stayed at, but I do remember that it was old fashioned, and we were all in one room together. There was a single bed (where I was sleeping), a double bed in the middle (my parents were there), and another single on the other side (my sister\u2019s).\n\nI was often frightened when I was a girl. I didn\u2019t like the dark, and I was super scared of the possibility of ghosts etc. I never found it easy to sleep because of this, even at home. I vividly remember tossing and turning that first night in the hotel for a long time, before lying on my back and trying to calm myself down. \n\nI then felt the bed sink a little next to my feet. I heard the creak of the old mattress. Someone was sitting at the foot of my bed. My heart was honestly pounding. I hadn\u2019t heard my sister or parents get up, so I was terrified. Whatever was sitting there quickly moved so it was sitting on my feet. I felt the weight of whatever it was. I heard the mattress creak again. My feet were freezing cold. It then moved off my feet, and settled down next to them again. The old mattress shifted and creaked again. \n\nWithin a second or two, I felt the coldest I\u2019ve ever felt, but not throughout my whole body. The coldness was slowly rising up from my feet, accompanied by a feeling of pressure. \n\nI was too scared to open my eyes.\n\nI was willing myself to call for my Mum, but I was so scared that I just couldn\u2019t at first.

The buildings towards the back were still being built and behind them was a big empty lot that had a dirt road you could walk down and at the end of that was a main road. One night a couple friends and I were hanging out and ended up walking down that road while we were just talking. On the way back as we approached one of the unfinished buildings we heard voices (they sounded male) and thought maybe there were people hanging out inside. But as we got closer the voices changed into what sounded like a little girl singing a nursery rhyme.  I couldn't make out any words, just a sing-song voice. The three of us booked it back to my apartment. \n\nThen sometime after that, maybe a couple months at the most I was lying in bed to go to sleep and what sounded like it was outside on the road in front of our place I heard that exact same voice singing but still wasn't able to understand the words.

This is my parent\u2019s story, but it is so good the internet needs it. Sorry for the extreme length. This is like a two-hour story when my parents tell it. They remember it even more vividly than I could type about it. This is 100% real. If you think otherwise, bugger off.\n\nPart 1: Mequon - Back in the 80s, my parents had just gotten married, graduated from college, and had my big brother. They moved into a small house in a very affluent neighborhood north of Milwaukee. The house was surprisingly in their budget (again, just graduated from college and med school with a little one) but was the smallest on the block. My parents made an offer that was a few under the asking price. Two other couples offered more than the asking (bidding war). However, the old man that owned the house rejected both of those offers and said he wanted my folks to have it. He said he and his late wife would have both agreed it was the right thing to do.\n\nMy folks are super grateful and are extremely excited to be living in the neighborhood. There are many youngsters so my brother had lots of playtime. Life was very good. Then, shit starts goin down.\n\nPart 2: Red Light - The first thing was with the basement. So, during this time my mom stayed at home with my brother and my dad was getting his practice started. He worked super late and was only home on Sundays basically. My mom did laundry in the basement and one day when she was walking up stairs, a red light at the bottom of the stairs turned on. Now I am told this is a super bright light, and the switch for it was taken out long ago. It is almost like a fallout shelter emergency light with a cage on it. My mom didn't know what to think, so she starts going downstairs to investigate, the light turns off. She figures that maybe it was some sort of surge. The next day, she goes downstairs again, comes up... the light is on again. Again starts walking down and it turns off. She does not shrug it off this time. She waits a bit at the bottom of the stairs and then walks back upstairs. The light turns on and she runs down this time to catch it, only this time... IT STARTS FLASHING LIKE A STROBE LIGHT before she can even reach the bottom. She nope'd the fuck out the house so quickly with my brother and didn't go back the rest of the day. The light never turned on for my dad or turned on again after that day.\n\nPart 3: Knock-Knock - After the red light thing my mom is naturally shook up. She is scared to go downstairs without my dad (rightfully so). But there was something that started before the Red Light but escalated after... knocking. My parents figured this was originally just natural sounds of the house as it was fairly old. It would be very sporadic and very infrequent, until one night\u2026 My parents were in bed chatting about the day, bills, etc etc. Then they started hearing knocking. It started in their room under the bed, then on the walls and ceiling. It would be about 30 seconds apart and they could not find a source. Then it sounded like the knocking was outside their room. So, they got up and tried following the sound and find where it was. They went all over the house trying to figure out where it came from. Every time they thought they found the source, it would jump to a different side of the room. They eventually were in the foyer/living room and tracked the knocking super frequently and super loud to the foyer closet. My mom had a fireplace poker in hand, and my dad a bat. He crept towards the closet and as he reached for the doorknobs, a voice calls out to them, \u201cKnock-Knock\u201d. He swung the doors open\u2026 there was nothing there, and all the knocking stopped. My parents could do nothing but stare at each other. Neither of them slept that night.\n\nPart 4: It Pushed Me - After the red light and knock-knock, my parents are wary of this house. My mom is on the verge of a breakdown and not dealing with this well at all. Remember she is in this house all day with this nonsense. My dad is usually more skeptical towards this kind of stuff, but he knows something is very wrong and thinks my mom is totally justified in her feelings. Well we fast forward a few weeks maybe even a month. It is a normal night like any other. My parents are asleep in their room, my brother in his. In the middle of the night (my mom suspects 2-3 AM can\u2019t be certain being all drowsy) my parents wake up to a huge THUD. Immediately my parents jump up and hear my brother is awake calling for them. They rush into his room and he is laying down in the very center of the room on the floor with his blanket perfectly taught and draped on him. As though he was tucked into bed, but on the ground at least 5 feet from his bed. My parents pick him up and ask him what happened. He responds pointing to the closet, \u201cIt pushed me! The fox pushed me.\u201d My dad opens the closet, rifles through everything looking for an animal, and of course finds nothing. So this is weird right? Why would a 3-year old say such a thing? Well, in this moment, my parents remembered the last name of the old man that sold them the house\u2026 Fox.\n\nPart 5: Reconciliation - I shit you not, my parents freaked out on this. There were too many things going on. My mom refused to let herself and my brother stay in the house especially since she was now pregnant with my sister. My dad decided he was going to take care of this. Again, he is not a superstitious man. He is a doctor and a man of logic. However, he knew there was something going on with this house. A night or two after the fox incident, my dad sat down in the living room and had a talk with the spirit of the house. He said this, \u201cI don\u2019t know if you are real. I do not know if you are Mrs. Fox, but I do know this, you are going to stop. We are a peaceful and loving family. If you are Mrs. Fox, your husband would be ashamed of you. He wanted us to have our family here because he knew you would want us to. Just as you raised your family here, I want to do the same. You may stay here as long as you like. But, you cannot do this to us anymore. I am sorry for your passing and for your pain, but you cannot take it out on us. My wife is pregnant, and you are causing her loads of stress. You even went after my son. This will stop, or I will seek out someone who will make it stop. Thank you, goodnight.\u201d After this, nothing bad happened to my family again. There were no lights, knocks, or foxes. But\u2026 (and this is the craziest thing ever) there was one final thing. In a wooden cabinet that my mom bought at a neighborhood garage sale a few days after they moved into the house, there was a card\u2026 an anniversary card. It said, \u201cHappy Anniversary ___ & ___! -Fox\u201d. This was found 2 days after my parents anniversary in June after they moved the cabinet to the other side of the room. They had owned the cabinet since they moved into the house and had not seen the old man since they bought the house either. My parents have moved many times over the years and lost the card inevitably. We still have the cabinet. It sits in our cabin to this day.\n\nThe End. (I removed my parents names because you are on reddit and I don\u2019t trust all of you)\n\nI FORGOT SOMETHING from Part 4: My brother was in the middle of the room put to bed on the floor. Well, after all the dust had settled my parents started renovating. They wanted to put carpet in my brother's room. So they tore up the tile/fake flooring stuff, and to quote my dad, \"Right where your f***ing brother was laying on the fox night, there was a blood stain!\" Mrs. Fox had died in the house, in my brother's room. She was very ill, but fell while trying to replace a light in the room.", "The summer after my freshman year of college I was spending a lot of time with this girl I met who lived near me.  There's a very popular part of town near me for bars/shopping/antique shops that has a lot of historical stuff and is surrounded by tons of woods.  It's also known to be somewhat haunted.  \n\nShe told my friend and I the story that there is a doll in the woods that if you find it and move it somewhere the ghost of the girl who owned it will come at night and place it back in its original spot.  My friend and I laughed and asked her where it was and agreed to come back that night and test it out.  We got there when it was very dark and started to look for the doll near ruins of where a building used to be.  The ruins were right near the road so we had the headlights from our car and flashlights.  After not that long searching we saw a really old looking doll sitting on a cement ledge.  I was creeped out that we actually found something, but picked it up and we called the girl to let her know we couldn't believe we actually found it.  She was so excited and agreed to come meet up with us.  I threw it as far as I could into the woods on the opposite side of the road and we got back in our car and drove to the bottom of this hill to the main road to meet up with her.  When she arrived we didn't really talk about what happened much, mostly just talking about where to go to get some food.  As we're standing there my car made that noise a car makes if it's already locked and you press the lock button on the key, just a quick beep.  I was concerned because my key was in my hand and I was positive I didn't touch it.  Then her car's alarm started going off as if someone had tried to break into it.  I was getting way too scared and said let's gtfo of here and get food.  But she was SUPER scared and begged one of us to ride with her, but neither of us wanted to.  So we agreed to check her car for any signs of a break in before we left.  As I'm checking her trunk for anything suspicious I peer through the window and saw something that created more fear in me than I've ever experienced before.  The doll was sitting in her trunk and propped up facing us.  At this point the girl was in tears and my friend and I are so scared I almost couldn't move.  I grabbed the doll rode back up to the top of the hill and put it right back where I found it and we sped off back home.  I never saw the doll again, and for years I refused to talk about it even with her or my friend, but now I enjoy telling it as a ghost story. ", "[deleted]", "I was home alone in my family home, in the basement where my room was watching TV. It was about 1am and I heard what sounded like someone breaking in upstairs. Directly above me was a dining room table and chairs and it sounded like someone had knocked over the whole thing and was stumbling through the dining room knocking into things.\n\nObviously I was terrified, and I turned off my TV and snuck towards the stairs and silently opened the door. I couldn't hear anything else so I slowly began to walk up the stairs expecting to see absolute destruction based on the noises.\n\nAs I rounded the corner there was nothing - just the dining room table and chairs sitting where they'd been left, nothing knocked over, no damage. The front door was shut, no windows broken and after a terrified look through the house, no one was there but myself.\n\nStill not sure what that was!", "My sister took me out to see Scary Movie 3. She was driving me back home (I was in middle school, while she is older than me and had already moved out of the house). We were joking around the whole car ride back, trying to scare one another and what not. \n\nFor context, the front of my old house had huge glass doors, so you could see into the living room from the street. As we are pulling up to my house we both were laughing and joking around, but then all of a sudden stop in unison. She turned to me and said \"did you see that?\". I had goosebumps all over my body after she said that to me, and the hair on my arms stood up. I asked her to tell me what she saw just to make sure she wasn't fucking with  me, which she loved to do from time to time. She described EXACTLY what I had seen. Which was a very pale man, with a long brown ponytail, in what looked like to be a long blue coat (almost looked like a revolutionary war soldier) standing inside our house, looking out to the street through one of the glass doors. At this point we were both freaking out because I told her that's exactly what I had seen too. We decided to take another loop around the neighborhood and pull up to my house again to see if the figure would still be there...which he wasn't. \n\nShe noped it the fuck out of there after doping me off.  I told my parents what we had seen and they just laughed and said \"you two are crazy\". That house was haunted and this was one of the many things that I experienced there, I'm glad my family has since moved. My sister felt the same way about the house, and tried to come by as little as possible seeing as it always gave her the creeps. My mom and dad also realized that the house was haunted, but they don't believe in the supernatural so they tried to dismiss everything as much as they could. ", "This isnt a super spooky story but I sure was spooked when it happened. My mom used to clean the house of a elderly couple. They didnt have any kids, so their house was empty aside from them. The husband ended up dieing of lung cancer and about a week after the service we were at their house cleaning. I was in their bedroom and my mom was in their restroom. I had my back turned to the bed and off to my left was a mirror that they had that was facing the bed. While cleaning I kinda half turned and momentarily looked into the mirror and see the ladys deceased husband standing next to the bed and looking down at it. He then looked up at me through the mirror so I quickly turned to look at their bed and he was gone. Really freaked me out at the time and I quickly joined my mom in the restroom.", "Not my experience, but my dads. He is a nurse, so he has told me some pretty scary stories. Probably one of the scariest was when this one guy was dying from liver failure (because he was a drunk his entire life). So there wasn't anything anybody could do except wait. \nNow, this guy was a hard-core atheist, according to my dad, and was not shy in making it known. So when the guy began to pass away, suddenly he gripped the sides of the bed really tight, and his eyes got really wide (like, \"Oh shit,\" kind of wide), and he starting yelling, \"Don't let them take me,\" over and over again. My dad said even after he was dead they had a hard time getting his eyes to unclutch the sides of the bed.  ", "I have two actually. It was while I was in college for my bachelor's.\n\nFirst one: there was this supposedly haunted dormitory on campus that was an all girls dorm. Now, I didn't believe in ghosts so I decided to live there because it was so cheap! Needless to say, strange things began to occur. Now, I'm someone who doesn't move in their sleep and I keep my nails trimmed. I woke up to scratches and handprint shaped bruises on my arms. I began to have nightmares every night, so badly I started sleeping with the lights on. Sometimes my bedroom door would not open at all, but I still wonder if that one was just a bad paint job. But the strangest thing was when all the girls on one floor had the same experience in one night. We all woke up at 3:30 am exactly with the distinct feeling we were being watched. We all left our rooms at the same exact time. It happened again at 6:30 am exactly. We never figured that one out. I smudged my room with white sage after that. \n\nSecond creepy story was when my friends and I were driving back to the college from another city two hours away. The college I went to was in the mountains in the forest. I was sitting in the back seat and her dog was laying in my lap, a big German Shepard who was very sweet and cuddly. All of the sudden he stood up protectively over me and began to growl and bark at the forest. He was alert and growling until we left the area. He then settled back down with his head on my lap. It was spooky, this dog had never done that the entire time my friend and I had raised him from a puppy.", "I posted this on another subreddit but thought it would fit here as well.\n\nMy father's cousin was getting married and she was shipping her wedding dress from the bridal store to us ( my mother was going to be doing some alterations on the dress). I clearly remember the box coming because my mother was remarking on the condition of the box.\n\nFast forward a few days later, I was with my great aunt talking about the wedding dress. She remarked about the condition of the box from shipping as well. I told her that my mother agreed when it came to our house. My great aunt turns to look at me saying that's cool and quickly changes the subject.\n\nLater that night, my parents come up to me saying that my great aunt called them and told them about the conversation. My mother tells me I must be remembering wrong since the box was never here, nor has she even seen what the box looks like.\n\nI get frustrated and tell her that she has seen the box and I run through the whole conversation we had days before. Again she tells me that never happened.  We go back and forth till I'm crying because no one remembers it happening but me.\n\nI know it happened because I was there talking to her. I even remember  how the light from the window hit the box and  carpet. It was terrifying, I felt like I was going crazy. I just put it out of my mind but to this day I still stand by that it happened. ", "Just to clarify this happened not too long ago and has bewildered me and my friends that attended. Also I am using another account as I don't want this tied to my main account.\n\nThroughout the year me and my friends have been going to an abandoned school close-by to where we live just on the out skirts of town. We liked to explore as it was big and quite an old building that looked cool and different, it was not open to the public in any way me and my friends had to find our own way in. There was a door that had been pried open by someone who was obviously there before us, in the many times we had been there we had always sworn to hear footsteps, voices and one time my friend claimed to have seen someone and at the time none of us believed him, he wasn't known for telling the truth alot.. Anyways we were usually in a group of 6 but one day it was just the three of us and we got bored and decided to go and check it out, whilst we were there it seemed very eerie and quite with the three of us till we heard a bang from the upper floor, we immediately had a retreat and ran outide the door(which was at the back).\n\nWe hung around for a while and around the outside of the building for anything out of the ordinary, bear in mind this was abandoned for years and years but we saw lights, alot of lights coming through a stained window to which we thought was a panel of buttons, almost like a janitors office. We tried to peek through the windows but we couldn't see anything but then all of a sudden a loud screech came from the tannoys placed all around the building and some sort of loud noise continued to play. We decided to sprint and climb the fence only to hear a dog barking as if we were being chased by something, we all managed to climb over the fence and as we glance over..no dog in sight, no more noise coming from the speakers. It just grew very quite.\n\nAround a week later or so later word had spread quickly in the newspaper, on Facebook etc. that the school had burned down, no casualties and it wasn't planned, suspicion grew but nothing has came from it since. We haven't yet went back to what remains and I don't think we plan too.\n\n*Not part of the story; Whilst googling the school whilst typing this I have just discovered that the school had a tragic fire in 1952, sadly killing 6 of the pupils, this was a dormitory school for non behaved male pupils. Was this a sign or a coincidence?", "Went with a friend to Seattle, went on both the Grunge Tour AND the Ghost Tour on the same day. Get back to the Air B&B and as we're standing talking about everything we saw, the torchere lamp in the living room, 10 feet away from both of us, flickers once and then literally turns itself off. As in, we both heard the 'click click' sound of the knob being turned. I looked at her, she looked at me, I went over and turned the light back on. The knob turns fine, nothing out of the ordinary. \n\nI still have no idea. I blame the wandering ghost of Kurt Cobain.", "We moved into an old three storey house that was built at the turn of the century. From the deeds we saw it was owned by a single woman for many years before being sold to a man, and then us - my husband and my grandmother. \n\nIt needed a lot of work doing but luckily the next door neighbor was a builder. He came in to do work while my grandmother visited my parents in another city. On the final day he said \u201cYour grandmother is always out working on the garden, it looks great!\u201d \n\nAfter I questioned him a bit I realised he had been seeing a white haired woman walking outside of the back bedroom window in the garden. It was definitely not my grandmother, she was 100 miles away. I never told him because he\u2019s really superstitious and probably wouldn\u2019t have come back!\n\nIn the same house while we were eating dinner I looked up and saw what looked like a huge black hooded figure hide behind the doorframe into the hallway. It was so big it looked like it was ducking down and peering into the room, before whipping up and away when I glanced over. That scared the hell out of me, particularly as I only looked up because the dogs were whining. I never went in that corridor again when the lights were off!", "I have dreams which are premonitions. Spooky because I dont know what the hell they mean about reality, and I dont know if they have a purpose. Everything from vividly dreaming about a massacre the day before if happened, to dreaming about what my kids are going to say when they wake up. Ill recount one if those, as its amusing rather than gut-wrenchingly sad.\nSo, last year I woke from a dream where one of my kids was sitting in one of those big coke fridges. Not in a freakish way, just chilling (ha) and looking around, quite happy. Anyway, I sat there for a while, remembering the dream (my dreams are pretty vivid) and thinking about the day.\nAfter about 5 minutes, the kid in question walks in to my room and starts his day by asking 'Do you think a person could fit in one of those fizzy drink fridges they have a take away shops?'.\nI guess our dreams were in synch or something? Anyway, apparently there's more in heaven and earth, or something...", "I went to a primary school that was well known in our town for being haunted before it shut down when I was in the third grade. \n\nEveryone in town, ex students and even my teachers who were students back in the day (not sure if they wanted to scare us) told the same stories about a little girl who died in the 50's in the school bathroom thats been haunting the school since. A girl really did die in the bathroom in the 50's but theres so many different versions I don't know how she really died - the most common version was she was electrocuted after being soaked in the rain. \n\nSo because of that kids (mostly the girls) in our classes would literally pee themselves in class. Not kidding. It happened so many times everyone stopped reacting when someone had an accident. Some of them claimed they saw the girl when they tried using the bathroom. My friends and I didn't believe in ghosts so we always used the bathroom. Nothing scary ever happened to us.\n\nBut one day during recess we were playing near the building block where the \"death bathroom\" was when all of a sudden we heard screaming from the inside. One of our teachers that was nearby bolted with us inside to see what happened. Down the hallway we see the new girl who had just recently transferred on the floor crawling out of the bathroom crying hysterically\nWhile we were trying to comfort her our teacher opened the bathroom door to check wtf was going on - the new girl screamed \"SHES.... ON... ON...THE....  PIPES!!!!!\" \n\nWe were all confused and checked the bathroom again we didn't see anything until one of our friends pointed to the pipes near the ceiling \"UP THERE!\" \nWe all froze for a solid 3 minutes while we stared at a wet school uniform swinging from the pipes. It was just so eery and creepy. There was no way in hell anyone could've done it as a prank since the ceiling was so high up you'd need two ladders connected to reach there - and the chance of just throwing a soaking wet uniform to hang from where it was hanging was just... impossible? it was like person had to have climbed up there to hang it like how youd hang a coat on a nail but upside down from the skirt plus the new girl didn't know about the stories and her reaction was enough for me to believe something fkn terrifying happened \n\nWhen she calmed down a few classes later she explained in a weak voice that she was walking out of the stall when suddenly she felt water drops dripping from the ceiling \nShe looked up and all she saw was hair, hands and a dead looking face slowly looking up at her with her mouth open - a girl was hanging upside down from the ceiling pipes. New girl was so terrified she dropped to the ground and struggled to crawl backwards towards the door whimpering \nThe girl hanging slowly lifted her hand and pointed at the new girl following where she was crawling with her finger as she was crawling out \nOnce the new girl managed to pull the door in to crawl out she had the strength to finally scream and cry\n\nYeah that traumatised the fk out of me and I wasn't even there", "Shared this on another thread, but equally as relevant here:\n\nMy mom just last week told me a story about when I was a kid. I had to be 4 or 5. We went to visit my grandmother's grave a state over. My mother and I lived with her and my grandfather until I was 3 and my grandmother died. My mom said my grandma and I were super close. We traveled from Indiana to Illinois and visited her grave (out in the middle of nowhere off of a gravel road with a forest just past the cemetery). My mom said I jumped up after visiting her grave site and started to run to the trees. My mom was only 21-22 at the time so she could keep up with me and asked me where I was going and I said \"I'm going to play with Mammaw! Look there's Mammaw!\"\n\nShe then said she scooped me up and took me to the car kicking and screaming because I couldn't understand why I couldn't play with my grandma.\n\nThen she told me that right after my grandma died when I was 3 that I would lay in bed and talk to her.\n\nWeird.", "My story isn't very spooky it is just really really weird. \n\nAt my mom's place, the garage is disconnected from our house and I was going to grab some drinks from the beer fridge for my boyfriend while I waited for him to come over. While walking the six or so feet to the garage this bird just starts attacking me and flapping its wings on my head. I am freaking out and run back inside. Once I am safe inside this bird flies to the back of my house and stares at me through the back windows, constantly chirping. I am scared shitless of this bird at this point and I am desperately waiting for my boyfriend's arrival. We stun the bird by hitting it with a cooking pan because this bird will not give up and it was still trying to attack me whenever I tried to go outside. The only explanation I have for this is that I was too close to its nest, which is weird because nothing like this has ever happened before, and while I do live kinda far from town I wouldn't say I'm really in the middle of the woods or anything.\n\nFast forward a couple days my parents and I were randomly watching our neighbor get home from work, weird I know, and I have no idea why all of us were looking out the window. She gets out of her car and some bird randomly flies up onto her arm from the ground. We all thought this was really trippy considering the whole bird incident a couple days earlier.\n\nA few more days go by and I am with my boyfriend for the Fourth of July and my mom calls me which is out of the ordinary since we usually text. She tells me our neighbor, who was the husband/partner of the one we watched with the bird, has died in a car accident. He died because a bird flew in his window while driving and he lost control of the vehicle.\nThis happened 3-4 years ago and my parents and I still get spooked by it.", "Sad but ghostly.\n\nI found and fostered a cat. She was beautiful. Snowshoe bluepoint Siamese. Basically my dream cat. And so so soooo cute. Big round eyes and little round face. I named her Penelope (Pep for short). \n\nSadly the stress of a new kitty was too much for my older cat so I gave Pep to a friend. Couldn't stand to never see her again. But at that point, I'd had her 3 months. But it just wouldn't work. She was so smart. Her favorite trick was High 5 because she always got a treat. She High 5'd all the time wanting treats. \n\nSo Pep lives with my friend Lisa. Pep had been skinny as hell when I found her, but she was getting healthier. One day I get a text from Lisa: \"I'm just gonna pretend you didn't know about this\". 4 kittens. \n\n2 grey girls, a black boy, and a blue tux boy that looked *exactly* like her in a different color. I had to keep him. I didn't know if my older cat would accept him but I was going to try. \n\nI named him Peppin and he came home at 7 weeks old. All was well.\n\nHe was *exactly* like his mother. When I brought him home, he went right for what her favorite toy had been when she had lived with me. He did everything she had done. He slept in her screwy positions, he layed in the cat tree with a paw hanging over like he was driving a two seater, all just like her. He walked like her, sounded like her, he had her face and her bone structure. If I had ever known what she would do in a situation I knew what he would do and I have never to this day been wrong.\n\nPep snuck out a window 3 months later and was killed by a car. \"Devastated\" doesn't come close.\n\nThe next morning, Peppin hops up on my bed and sits there. Waits until I pay attention to him. Then very, very deliberately, like Pep always did, gave me a High 5.\n\nI never taught him that. He never saw Pep do it (she would only do it for me, not Lisa). There was no way he could have learned it. \n\nBut yet, there is was, the morning after she died. \"I made it. I'm ok. I'm right here.\"\n\nI'm not religious and occasionally spiritual. But I have a feeling, somehow, that that's her. Like she knew she didn't have long and repackaged herself. At first I thought I was seeing it because I wanted to. Of COURSE there's a resemblance between mother and offspring. Of course there's similarities. But *everything*??? And he looks. exactly. like. her. If they were the same color they would be indistinguishable. \n\nAnd how did he learn to High 5? Considering he's never done it since, and had never done it before. I can't even teach him. He knows other tricks. He can sit, stand up, fetch, roll over.... but he won't learn High 5. ", "My wife and I stayed at a nice hotel in downtown Pittsburgh. It was where I asked her to marry me after a lavish meal. I picked the room because it came with a huge Japanese soaking tub that me, a 6'1 man, could barely see over the edge of.\n\nAnyway, the first night we stayed there, we were sleeping in the single king bed. I believe the alarm clock said it was 2 or 3am. To my left, and just a few feet from me, I heard the sound of a what seemed like a pencil slowly rolling down a sloped surface. It was so deliberate and loud that it woke us both up. It was also so deliberate that, while my heart thumped in my chest from the sudden noise, I quickly convinced myself that it was a pencil sliding off the desk in our room and I went back to sleep.\n\nThe next morning, to my surprise, I found that a.) there were no pencils in the room and b.) there was no desk. It was my first night in the room so I assumed that it, like other hotels, had a place to sit and write. Well--that was not the case. The only thing I could find to write with were ballpoint pens with their caps on. They wouldn't make that distinctive, loud noise that a ridged, wooden pencil makes as it rolls. Furthermore, there was no sloped surface in the room for anything to suddenly roll off of in the middle of the night / morning.\n\nThe whole thing was weird enough for us to talk about it that morning. I do not believe in ghosts but to be honest, I'd love to encounter something unexplained. I entertained the idea of a ghost pencil, but knew in my head it had an explanation grounded in reality.\n\nBut that's not all that happened.\n\nThat night we were both in the soaking tub. The water was up to my chin. It was great--we were in the middle of February, a cold and miserable month in Pittsburgh. We were sloshing around in the tub having a blast, pretending we were rich.\n\nAnd then, from the other room, we heard the buzzing of an old microphone hooked up to a PA system. Basically, that sound of feedback that precedes an announcement. The whole room filled with the buzzing sound of microphone feedback. Our hearts thumped in our chests yet again. And then we both practically jumped out of our own skins.\n\nWe heard the distinctive sound of someone blowing into a microphone to test it. \"Whoooth Whooth.\" You could see it in your head it was so distinctive, just like the pencil. My heart went from thumping wildly to thrumming like a hummingbird's. Naked, I lept from the tub and threw a towel around myself.\n\n\"That was a man blowing into a microphone.\" I said. My wife stayed in the tub, scared and quiet. I searched our room and did not find a speaker, or any kind of speaker grill embedded into a wall or the ceiling. We could not for the life of us find a potential source for the sound other than an iHome speaker that was already playing music from my iPhone.\n\nSo that was our story. We still had one more night. We were exhilarated by our engagement and the ghosts that haunted the hotel.\n\nA week later I had the thought to email the hotel. I asked them about their building. Pittsburgh is an old town. And downtown Pittsburgh is a very very old town. They got back to me and explained, as my jaw dropped, that they used to be an old telephone factory.\n\nI don't know why I found meaning in that explanation or why it made everything click so well. But my thoughts immediately went to the sounds of a factory--the PA system, the drafting table. All relics from another time in that building's life.", "I swear we ran into a man from another time. My step-sister and I were like maybe 9 and 11 years old and we had ventured a like 10 kilometers from the house into the forest to explore and play (grew up rural, this is just what you do!). We were way off the trail amongst these enormous valleys (by Ontario standards). Like the type that you can't just walk straight up because it's too steep. So this isn't an easy place to really get to and there are very few houses that back onto this particular piece of land. We were walking about and chatting when all of a sudden this man appears like 3 feet from us wearing a cowboy hat and a suede-like vest. He walked by (again, not anywhere near any trail) and didn't say anything then all of a sudden we didn't see him anymore. He was heading downhill so we should have had a good vantage point to continue seeing him but he was gone. You'd think if you randomly came across any other person in such a place you'd be like \"oh, hey, what's up?\" or \"hey, have a nice walk\" or something! But he didn't even look at us, just walked by silently then disappeared. At the time it was like \"meh, strange\" and we continued playing around but a few years later we realized how strange that was. Just inexplicable and odd.", "A hand appeared behind the refrigerator, it slapped a bag of bread to the floor. Thought it was just a prank and someone wedged themselves behind the fridge to pull off this \"prank\", but there was no one there and no way anyone could have been. Harmless but spooky.", "There was one time where 2 of my friends and I (all about 12 years old) were hanging out this small walking trail just off the main road.  Trying to decide what to do next, an unkempt guy in a trench coat hopped over the guardrail to the road and started walking towards us.  We decided to leave at that moment when the guy said \"Haven't seen you guys in a while\" as he got closer to us.  We all ran for it going around a different path trying to get out of there.  As we were running, I tripped on a tree root and went down hard, busting my elbow, looking back seeing this man walking toward me I thought I was going to die.  I got up and ran to my friends blood dripping from my elbow.  We made it back to the main road and thought we lost him, just as we start to turn away, the crazy guy walks out from behind the bushes about a hundred feet away.  We then hightailed it into a deli down the street and hid behind some shelves inside the store looking at the door to see if he followed us in.  Just as we are about to leave, he pokes his head in and we run behind the deli counter asking for help, panic all over our faces, saying that a psycho guy was following us.  One of the workers grabbed a knife and went to go confront the guy.  He kept him busy while my friends Dad showed up and got us out of there.  As we were driving away, the sketchball was standing outside the deli, his trench coat blowing in the wind revealing a big machete like blade hanging on the inside.", "When I was 20 (I'm 32 now) I was sleeping next to my fiance. I woke up in the middle of the night (definitely awake, not dreaming) to see a shadowy figure over me. I thought it was my fiance. The figure then went through the closed door, and I looked to my right to see my fiance asleep next to me. I was then paralyzed with fear for about five minutes. \n\nNo, I have no real explanation for it. But it definitely wasn't a dream.", "The house I grew up in was fairly old and my dad did some serious renovations to it. I always got the creeps from the attic, which was a full third story and eventually my dad fixed it up as a kind of 2 bedroom apartment for me and my older brother. One night when I was maybe 13, while everyone else was asleep I heard three loud bangs on the wall outside of my room, right next to my head. Important note: The stairs were on the other side of the wall in a traditional Victorian style (some steps, then a landing, 180 degree pivot, more steps), so the point on the wall where the bangs were coming from was about 8 feet off the ground. Directly after the bangs, the touch lamp next to my bed started going crazy. It had four settings: off, dim, bright, brightest and it cycled through them without being touched for about thirty seconds while out in the big, open living area, our stereo turned on at full volume blaring some crazy punk album I had just discovered. I quickly ran out of my room and turned the stereo off, not wanting to wake anyone else in my family and then just kind of sat in my room with a light on until I could fall back asleep. This was probably the creepiest experience I ever had in the house, but definitely not the only one.", "When I was in high school I lived with my aunt in Oregon while my parents and brother were all still in Arizona. One night I had a very vivid dream of driving up to a lookout spot above a canyon and parking my car behind my brother's truck. As I was getting out of my car I noticed that there were two other people there besides myself, my brother who had his back turned to me as he looked out over the canyon, and my brother's friend Brian who was walking toward me. Brian told me hello and that it was nice to see me but I should just go. I didn't understand why I had to leave and I couldn't keep my eyes off of my brother. I asked Brian what was wrong with my brother but he wouldn't tell me. I knew there was something seriously off about my brother but I couldn't tell exactly what it was.\n\nI woke up the next morning with the dream still in my head. It didn't fade throughout the day either. Instead it kept haunting me. I knew I was missing something that I couldn't figure out so I kind of forced myself to forget about it. \n\nAt about 5pm that evening I was woken up by my father who was looking for my mom's phone number. My brother had been snowboarding earlier that day and he jumped off of a small cliff and broke his leg in 6 places below the knee.\n\nWas my dream trying to tell me that something was going to happen to my brother? Was the accident supposed to be worse? Why was I \"warned\"? Was it a simple coincidence? If so why have I never had a dream about my brother before or since?

I was a skeptic but had nothing better to do. About 4-5 hours in I was sitting in a chair next to a closed door. The doorknob turned, opened halfway, then all the way, then slammed shut. I then felt steps next to the chair. I am no longer fully a skeptic. ", "Just happened today. I was sitting at my computer with no audio playing.

I don't remember when she said he divorced my grandmother but it wasn't a good time and he had a new girlfriend rather quickly. But he would always stop by on her birthday and get her something. The last time my mom saw her dad was on her 14th birthday and he died sometime later that year. But she swears up and down, that on the morning of her 15th birthday while she was brushing her hair that this little music box that he bought her on her 14th birthday started to play on it's own. It only managed the first 6 or 7 notes and then stopped, but she swears it had to be her dad wishing her happy birthday. ", "There was one night I was home alone.

So it didn't take long to quickly search the room.\n\nThen I thought maybe I left it somewhere downstairs. So I went downstairs for a quick search but had no success. So now I'm thinking of all the scenarios that could have happened. Did I leave it at work? Is it still in my car? I could have sworn I placed it on my side table. So I decide I'll go check my car. I go upstairs to go get my keys. I walk in to my room to find my phone sitting neatly on top of my pillow. \n\nNow I know for a fact it wasn't there before because I had  thoroughly searched my bed, lifted the pillows.

Nothing has happened ever since.", "When I was younger we use to live in this creepy house. We always got weird vibes from it and until after we moved I found out other's experienced things just like I did.\n\n(Here's a story from that time)\nI was in my parents bedroom with them. We were all awake watching the TV. My dad was eating a snack and I decided I was going to go get one too. I walk to the kitchen and look in the fridge. The fridge was right next to the entrance of the kitchen. I'm looking for my snack and I happen to look out into the hallway and I see something walking down the hall. It was white so I figure it's my dad since he use to wear nothing but white shirts. I go back to their room and I ask my dad why he was walking around and he and my mom swore they never left the room.\n\n\nThat house always gave me weird vibes. My dad and uncle heard a baby crying when they checked out the house for the first time before we moved in. My cousin (who use to live with us) would always wake up crying because \"people were shaking her bed\". Her and I also saw a shadow walk across the living room into the hallway and disappear. ", "About 5 years and 2 boyfriends ago, I moved into an old farmhouse with my then-significant other. He was a hoarder and was embarrassed about the state his house was in after his wife left him. \n\nHe had an RV and that's where he slept, because there was just shit--garbage, clothes, boxes--up to your knees in every room of the house.\n\nMe, being extremely distressed by clutter, cleaned that house. Down to cobwebby corners of the ceiling, it took me weeks but I murphys oiled every inch of wood, filled his truck with over 10 loads of garbage. \n\nThe very first night I was there, things were weird. At that point I had only cleared part of the living room.  The boyfriend snored unbearably loud so I opted to sleep inside, on the couch, while he slept out in his camper. \n\nI had just had a fight with my mother and was lying awake around 4 a.m. fuming about it. I heard my boyfriend come in the back door, muttering to himself as usual.  He was opening and closing drawers and cabinets in the kitchen, figured he was searching for something.\n\nFinally I got up because hell, I was already awake, maybe I could help him find whatever it was. The kitchen was 5 feet from where I was and when I walked in, there was no one there. I looked around and called for him but he wasn't there.\n\nI don't get scared easily and at this point I was just curious about where he was. I went out the camper and could hear him snoring hard before I even got to the door. I shook him awake and asked him gently what he had needed in the house. He said he hadnt left the camper all night. \n\nI thought, eh, he was sleep walking. When I went back inside, though I noticed it had snowed lightly in the night and the only tracks leading up to the camper were mine. \n\nCouple days later, I move my two cats in.  They are super on edge, a lot of growling, acting out of character, especially in the middle of the night. I completely dismissed that as it was a new, unfamiliar place, obviously they were uncomfortable. I had finally gotten the bedroom habitable and they would not cross the threshhold into it. \n\nThe first night we slept in the bedroom was when I started to fear the house. The bed was up against a window that faced out to the cornfield and my guy insisted on sleeping on the outside of the bed, leaving me pressed against the window. \n\nI got this horrible feeling. Something was right outside the window and I was frantic to the point of tears--I kept telling him there was something out there and he said I was being dramatic, which was stupid, because I'm just not.  You spend your whole life being logical and calm and when something weird happens, no one believes you. \n\nI slept on the couch. The next day, I noticed a handprint. On the top of the bedroom window that I had just cleaned the day prior. I held my hand up to it and it was thrice the size of my own hand, bigger than any person's handprint Ive ever seen.  It wasn't just a print, though, it was elongated, as if the hand had dragged down the window. \n\nStill could be an explanation (even though I had cleaned that window the day before and would have noticed) except the print was over 9 feet off the ground *directly over an open coal cellar*. \n\nI showed my boyfriend and he told me something surprising--his ex wife thought there was something wrong with the house too. She was making dinner one day and he had gotten home from work, her back was turned to him and they had a full conversation. \n\nThen she looked out the kitchen window and saw him pull up in his truck. \n\nHe still blew it off with me, just telling me I was paranoid and such. All this time, I assumed he was right, dismissed my instincts and went about things normally. \n\nThen one morning in the spring I got up to use the bathroom. It was 4:46 in the morning and I knew the time because I checked my phone when I got up. The whole bedroom was light from the sunrise and I quietly climbed back into bed. \n\nThe house is all wood panelling and because of my arachnophobia I had the bed scooted about 5 inches away from the wall where our heads were. \n\nI laid down and tucked my arm up under the pillow with my hand over the edge. The second I closed my eyes, an icy cold hand grabbed me by the wrist and yanked down. *HARD*.  I bolted up and in a state of complete terror shook my boyfriend awake and asked if he was fucking with me. \n\nHe wasn't.  I will never forget that grip because I had to struggle to get my hand back. \n\nI called my close friend and she said \"You know that there's a cemetary within view of your bedroom, right?\"\n\nI had forgotten, but being a practical person it had never occurred to me that there might be a connection. She said \"Let's try something\", came over with a sage brush and we smudged the house. We were both laughing at ourselves as we did it, but the thing is, nothing weird happened after that. Well, except me falling into a hole in the floor.  But I blame that on my own clumsiness. \n\nThe relationship withered, I moved out, but we remain friends.

There\u2019s either a second elevator in this building (there wasn\u2019t, we checked) or she really hauled ass upstairs while we were going up via the real elevator.\n\nShe turns left and disappears. We assume she just went down a second stairway that we didn\u2019t see coming up the first time and follow her since we needed to get down anyways and didn\u2019t want to take the elevator.\n\nNope, she turned left into a dead end brick wall. She and the dog are nowhere to be found, not on the street outside or in the alley behind the building. What the fuck?\n\nWe scour the whole building and find out that there\u2019s only one stairway, on the opposite side of the building, and only one elevator, the one that we used. \n\nSo how the fuck did she get up there so quickly, and how did she get down without passing us if she didn\u2019t take the elevator and we clearly saw her turn left into a brick wall?\n\nGhosts.

When I first moved in, I kept having nightmares and daytime \"visions\" of a girl who'd hung herself in my bathroom. They gradually went away, but ever since I started the process of moving out (I leave in two days) things have gotten insane. The closet door keeps opening by itself, i've watched bags in the kitchen and the comforter on my bed shuffle around on their own, i've seen other people in the bathroom mirror, and i've been having increasingly bizarre and vivd nightmares. The one last night involved me getting out of bed, promptly falling back over and having a seizure, something i'm not prone to at all, and I seriously don't know if it happened for real or not. \n\nI think whatever is here is upset that i'm leaving. Funny way of showing it. ", "I used to act with a theatre company which operated out of a building that dated back 800 odd years. Obviously with a building of that age there were lots of ghost stories, but I don't believe in ghosts so payed them no heed but enjoyed watching people freaking out. \n\nI'd been there a couple of years when they renovated one of the attic rooms and updated it to be a changing room. \nWe'd rehearse from Autumn then have six weeks of performance over six weeks in the summer with three different plays alternating over this time. I was in one play but got roped in to do some background work/ crowd scenes in one of the other plays, The Tempest. In one of the final scenes my costume consisted of essentially a white stocking covering my face a huge white unkempt wig and a loin cloth with body paint (I was an angry spirit of sorts, lurking in shadows).\n\nOne night it was coming up to the final scene but for reasons I can't recall now I didn't go on stage (I was one of many so had no impact on the scene). I left the theatre and walked through the woods to the back entrance of the hall (it's an outdoor theatre.... in fact here's the link so you can see the place http://stamfordshakespeare.co.uk/tolethorpe-history/ the changing room was in the nearest roof in the pic - lots of changes since that pic ) slipped through the hall and took the back stairs up to the changing room. The room used to be servant quarters so the entrance was really tight, about as wide as my shoulders, and up about four floors of wooden stairs. Half way up I could hear someone singing in the changing room. \"Brilliant\", I thought, \"no-one is expecting me here, this is the perfect opportunity to scare the shit out of one my friends\". So, pulling my mask over my face, fixing my wig, I crept up the final two floors, readied myself by the open door and leapt into the room. \n\n\"RRRAAAAAARRGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nThe room was empty. The singing which had gotten louder as i climbed the stairs had stopped the second I leapt into the room.  I was confused.  Then I was terrified.  The singing was as real as if someone was stood next to me. There was no way anyone was hiding.  There was no way out of that room without physically moving me to pass me on the stairs. \n\nI noped the fuck out of there and ran back to the theatre to wait for other sensible adults to escort me back up to get changed.  People thought I was joking when i told them until they could see how utterly bewildered and freaked I was.  Later, when the audience had gone we tried shouting and calling from outside to see if the noise could have gone from somewhere else.  Nothing. \n\nI still don't believe in ghosts, but there was 100% singing coming from a room with no people in it.

My old childhood home has three stories with a cellar and is built in such a way that the floors are thin. Sound travels very well through it. \n\nThe basement has a piano, which my brother, a musician, spent a lot of time on as a teenager. To that end, one morning, I hear him playing and singing at the top of his (very distinct) voice. I yelled over the upstairs stairwell for him to shut up because he was being loud and obnoxious. \n\nThen, I remembered my brother wasn't home that day; he had gone out with my parents. Music stopped, and I investigated the basement to find it dark. \n\nFor years, I was able to mostly brush this off as sound from outdoors or something I imagined, but this week, my brother and I are back home for the holidays. It happened again. \n\nNow, the basement stairwell leads into a corridor, and off the corridor are three rooms: a full bathroom, a laundry room, and the rec room, which holds the piano. I was showering with the bathroom door open. \n\nI got out, brushed my teeth, and all the while, I could hear my brother playing and singing from rec room. Not an unusual occurrence, but the music did stop on its own at some point. So, I finished what I was doing, put on my robe, and made my way back upstairs.\n\nMy brother was standing in the kitchen. Now, there was absolutely no way he could have gotten upstairs without having to walk past me. I asked him if he had been in the basement at all, and he was rather insistent he hadn't been in the basement all day. \n\nI went back to check the cellar out to find nothing amiss. Spooky!

My brother always swore he heard footsteps walking down that hall when he stayed up late on weekends playing in the next room. I believe in the paranormal but dismissed his statement. That was until this morning.    Slightly groggy I made a bowl of cereal, sat at the dining table with the hall to my right and the sliding glass door to our patio in front of me. It had those thick plastic blinds covering the whole thing and turned closed to cover the windows. I'm chomping away at my food when a single blind swings strait out a foot out or so from the base and returns to resting position. No sway from being bumped, didn't even connect with the glass just inches behind it. Just out, in, stop. After several moments the hvac kicked on leading me to believe the ac/furnace was not the culprit. I bumped the blinds hoping to debunk it but it always bumped the glass and swayed for a time before coming to an unsteady rest. I checked for drafts around the window and door seal, nothing but a slight coolness from the aluminum trim and the wind outside was non-existent. In the end I could not prove the event as anything other than the paranormal. Since then the midnight creeks in that long and narrow hallway to my door always reminded me I was never alone in my home.    Bonus: as soon as the blind stopped moving I sat up alert, pointed at the door and called out \"Do that again.\" No success. Thanks for reading.", "I already posted this to r/paranormal a while back, but....\n\nI was a freshman in college in 2004, where my high school best friend and I shared a dorm room in a suite that housed four. Our dorm was new; it was built the year before we came to school. A few weeks after we started college, he and I were laying in our respective beds, both of us falling asleep (he may have been asleep at this point--sleep never came that easily for me).\n\nLights were out. Laptops were closed. We didn't have a TV in our room (the tv was in the common area outside our room). In 2004, we only had Nokia brick phones, so no one was playing on their phone from bed. Like I said, lights out.\n\nAnyway, as I was just drifting off to sleep, right in that twilight phase between consciousness and dreaming, I awoke to what sounded like a loud mix of twisting metal and powerful electric current. It was coming from inside my dorm room--just feet away from within the empty space between the foot of my bed and my roomie's bed. As soon as the noise began, I also heard a voice.\n\nAt first, I couldn't understand what the voice was saying. Not because it was quiet--it was LOUD. But the words were unintelligible gobbledygook. Imagine the Tasmanian devil from Loony Tunes--just speaking total jibberish--except this voice was very angry. It sounded malicious. Evil.\n\nThe voice cut right over the loud metallic/electric sound, and reverberated as if it was coming though a large PVC pipe. Eventually, I understood the words \"COCKSUCKERMOTHERFUCKER\" and a few more curse words. The voice and the clanging went on for maybe a total of 10 seconds.\n\nThen everything went silent.\n\nI laid in bed with the covers over my face for what seemed like forever. Eventually either I or my roomie asked the other if they had heard he voice. We both did.\n\nAt some point one of us mustered the courage to turn on a light and check out the room. We thought maybe someone had been playing a prank on us. We checked for speakers in our air vents, checked our laptops to see if some pop-up ad had played a sound, and explored other scenarios. We eventually asked the guy in the room next to us if he had heard anything (he was a quiet guy and we didn't suspect him of prancing us). He hadn't.\n\nTo this day I have no idea what that was.\n\n", "Late to the party but its a good story.\n\nThis is about eight years ago when I was still with my Ex and her two kids, but the household had been plagued for a couple weeks with intense and bad dreams. We were all sitting around dinner one night and somebody started talking about how bad their dreems have been and everybody else chimed in about how bad theirs had been too.\n\nI'm a pretty lucid dreamer, where I'll realize I'm dreaming and either just fuck around, practice flying, or just bail on the dream altogether. \n\nWell, a few days pass and one night I'm sleeping and I have this particularly vivid dream about me fighting a demon.  And it's not a fun movie demon fight, it's pretty intense. So in my dream, I start reciting this incantation. I don't remember what I was saying or how I knew it, but I remember it being English in the dream.  I also realize I'm fighting this demon in a dream, so I will myself to speak this incantation out loud in the real world. This wakes up my ex who was sleeping next to me. \n\nThis wakes up my ex, and she goes, \"Armorphoenix, you're talking in your sleep.\"\n\nAnd I go, \"I know.\"\n\nAnd she asks, \"Why?\"\n\nTo which I respond, \"Because spells are more powerful when you say them out loud.\" right as I roll over and go back to snoring.\n\nFreaks her out a little bit, she tells me the next day that the stuff I was speaking didn't sound like gibberish but it wasn't English. But after that, no more spooky dreams for the household. ", "My computer turned on by itself once. I was 14 and it wasn't connected to the internet.

At my dad's house, he had his bathroom in his room redone about a year ago. The plumber worked with his son, and thought he heard him greet someone coming in. When asked about it (my dad would have been at work, so the plumber was confused as to why his son would have greeted my dad, who wouldn't be home for a while), his son said he never said anything to anyone and that my dad wasn't there. Apparently several others happened to the plumber while he was there, but I can't remember specifics. Personally, while walking to my room, I could have sworn I saw someone walking into my sister's room at the end of the hall. If I remember correctly I thought it was my dad, who I was looking for, but when I got to the door, it was closed and no one was in there when I opened it. My dad was in a other room. The 3rd and final was I swear one night I heard something breathing under my bed. I thought that maybe it was my cat being loud, or maybe the blind rubbing on the crank for the window, but it was neither. All 3 of these stories were in my dad's house.", "Several years ago when my son was young I was sitting at the computer doing some work when I heard him wake up. \nHe made the tiny whimper sound and the typical toddler, pathetic sounding cry/moan \"mommmyyyyy\".

I had a decent gps in my truck. It was in the fall and around 9pm. I followed my gps going at a decent speed of around 80km/hr. Suddenly, the road came to an abrupt stop and narrowed. I slammed on the brakes but it became a sloped ATV trail and I slid down the slope. \n\nMy truck scrapped into the side of a tree and knocked off my mirror. As I collected myself, I looked adjacent to my truck and there was a white beat up van. As I stared at it for a few seconds I noticed curtains inside be pulled apart and an eye look at me. \n\nImmediately, I drove my vehicle forward the best I could. I made it about 30 feet than came to a dead end. As I turned around I noticed headlights from the van turn on.

Once the van left I waited a few minutes and left as well. \n\nReally spooked me and haunted me for a week or so after the incident. To this day I still wonder what was going on there.

Both times it was around 3 AM and I ran downstairs terrified, only to find nothing. This happened the first two nights in the house, but never since.\n\nI am wondering if it was the duct work warping in the walls or something similar as the house hadn't been occupied for a few months prior to me moving in. Still scares me now though with how loud the banging was.", "I was an RA at a dorm for a community college.  The year before, a guy I knew committed suicide on the 3rd floor.  I have a couple that come to mind.\n\n-3rd week of school, I get a call on the RA phone while I'm on call.  A girl (I ended up dating later, but that's not important to the story) called screaming along with her three roommates crying.  Trying to figure out what was happening, I get told to run up there.  As I'm running the flight of stairs, I hear a door slam and a bunch of screaming.   I get there and all four girls are crying and curled up in the fetal position.  By this time, residents were starting to circle.  My best friend at the college, another RA, finally gets there and we get people back to their rooms.  The girls finally stop crying and tell us that something demonic just happened.  My friend and I roll our eyes and try to get their story.  Apparently, as they were getting ready to go to bed, a lamp got thrown off a night stand.  After that, a cup thrown off the table.  Then a plate broke.  Finally the entire dining room table gets flipped over.   \n\nMy friend and I get in there and...yeah.  Table was flipped, but so were a couple chairs, broken dishes everywhere, and lights were burned out.  I thought it was a prank, but these girls refused to sleep in that room for at least a week.  The girl I ended up dating still stands by the story and I wasn't allowed to ask much about it.\n\n-Same year, same dorm.  I'm sitting in the RA office, and it's late.  Probably near midnight when I close up for the night.  One of the basketball players that I'm cool with, comes up to the window.  We are talking, and a white girl's hand taps him on the shoulder.  I am thinking it's this one girl that had a crush on the basketball player.  Two seconds later, the basketball player looks at me and says, \"Did someone just tap my shoulder?\"  I nod and he looks around and says \"Who the fuck?\"  \n\nLet me describe what I can see.  In front of me, through the window I can see the lobby and lounge area with couches and a tv, and the main stairwell. To the left, there is a blind spot where the elevator is (where I assumed the girl came from) and if I lean back, to my left I can see down the big hallway that has suites and at the end of the hall, a stairwell.   So after the basketball player asks who tapped him, we look around.  I see no one.  I ask if someone came out the elevator.  Nope, elevator is on the third floor.  I check the cameras, I see no one on any nearby feed.   We both nope'd out.  I locked up early, the basketball player left the dorms for a couple weeks. \n\nI have other paranormal stories, but those two still haunt me.  I couldn't explain either.", "In college, every time I would walk into my dorm room, my AC would be set to 55 degrees which was the lowest it went. It would take forever for my room to heat up and I am always cold to being with so it was irritating. After like three weeks of this, I went over to my cousins house to stay the night because I was tired of freezing my ass off. We were hanging out with some of her sorority sisters and one asked where I stayed. I told her the name of the Hall and she proceeded to tell me to stay away from room 316 and that it was haunted. She apparently lived there her freshman year and a lot of weird shit happened to her. 316 was my damn room.\n\nSo the next day I went to go talk to my roommate and confronted her about the AC. Her parents lived in town and she was always there and so I explained how it irritated me that she set the AC so low when she never really stayed there anyway. She very adamantly denied changing the temperature but I didn't really believe her because I knew I wasn't doing it. So we decided to set the AC to 75 and go get lunch together. I'll be damned if we didn't come back to it set at 55. I didn't sleep there for a week. After that I realized, I'm just being stupid and if there is a ghost, setting the temp low is really not all that bad. So I bought a ton of sweaters. Then a few months later, my roommate pledged for a sorority and had been busy all the time. She had a night off so we sat up talking before bed. We are in the middle of a conversation and a bright flash of white light came from the TV and then a low humming noise came right after. She jumped from the bed and unplugged the TV. It was kinda freaky but we decided to try to get some sleep. As we are wrapping up our conversation, it happened again. We both darted out of the room and slept in the common area of the main building.\n\nAbout a month into the summer, I found an article about how a girl committed suicide on the third floor of the dorm about 30 years before I went there. The article didn't state the room number but I'll bet it was my old room.", "I live in Phoenix so earthquakes aren't really a issue\n\nMy SO and I were laying in my bed talking when 3 out of my 25 blinds started to vibrate. I have a 8ft window in my master bedroom and vertical blinds. 3 random blinds start vibrating and it's pretty audible. I walk over and feel the blind rod and it's not moving and vibrating, I grab the 3 blinds and stop them, I walk away and they start shaking again on their own. Her and I just sat there baffled by this, five minutes later they stop...never had it happen again", "A little bit of exposition, when I was in high school there was this old dilapidated plantation style mansion that had been completely abandoned for years.  My friends and I would go out there from time to time to creep ourselves out.  I probably went out there about 3 or 4 times over my high school years.  We all called it the Osteen house because it was near to Osteen, Florida.  When I say that this place was creepy, I mean it was legitimately like Stephen King nightmare creepy.  Firstly, it was way out in the middle of an almost primitive jungle swampy forest in Florida.  Night time in places like that has a way of becoming almost otherworldly, with the huge moss covered live oaks completely blocking out the stars and the thick under growth and all of the animal noises you hear.  I have no idea who had lived there or how long it had been abandoned but it had been a long time.  There were holes in the floor and dangerous staircases and was probably not a safe place to be, and certainly not a place that you would want to just hang out by yourself.  Inside the house there were all sorts of satanic symbols, red painted pentagrams and very well drawn satanic goats and stuff, not really just like it was some stupid kids that had done it. On the floors were candles and ritualistic symbols and what not where it looked like people had been doing occult rituals or something.\n\nSo this one night, my friends and I are bored so we decide to go out there again for shits and giggles.  You can barely see the house back through the woods from this shitty dirt road and we start making our way towards it.  The place was completely silent and pitch black save for our flashlight beams.  As we were getting nearer to the house, which had been in our view the entire time, we noticed that someone had placed a burning candle in the top window, on the third floor.  We definitely would have noticed it walking up so someone must have been watching us and lit the candle when we got close to fuck with us.  The idea of some creepy cult members watching us in pitch black silence really creeped us out.  I have no idea who it would have been but we noped the fuck out of there very quickly and we never went back after that.  Last I heard the house had been demolished finally by the county in the past few years.", "I know this isn\u2019t as creepy as the other stories here, but here it goes.\n\nI usually have to take the ferry to commute to uni, and this time I had been studying for a while and had to take the night time ferry. \n\nI sat down on my phone when I noticed a strange man walking slowly back and forth in the ferry, eyeballing ever passanger he walked past. The dude was in his fifties and had a gangster/mafia vibe. I even remember texting my friend and saying that there was a wierd dude walking back and forth in the ferry. \n\nAbout 10 minutes before the ferry arrived, a man went out to the deck, most likely to get to his car. The mafia dude quickly followed him outside. A minute or so later, I heard this scream from the outside. And it wasn\u2019t like any other scream, it was a proper scream of real fear from a grown man, lasted about two seconds. I looked around to see if any other passangers noticed it, but couldn\u2019t see anyone reacting.\n\nI was confused when I left the ferry, and look back just as I was leaving it. I than spotted the wierd dude stand on the upper deck in the darkness just watching all the passangers leave the ferry. His eyes met mine and I was horrified. It was almost like he knew that I suspected him.\n\nNeedless to say, I rushed to my car that was parked on the parking lot. Worst part was that it was full of ice that I had to scrape off before driving. When driving home, I was horrified and paranoid that he was following me.

As im looking up straight to were the noise was coming from someone or something punched the closet from the inside and this was a strong and loud punch to the right closet door (the closet had both doors closed at the moment) so I just froze to death I couldnt belive that shit seriously so I froze to death full on goosebumps and stared at the closet for atleast 10 minutes before deciding to go towards it, I got real close to the right door and for some reason just tried hearing whatever was going on inside my closet and boom another punch like a legit punch almost like someone from the inside even knew I was standing right there... I opened the door and nothing... Everything was fine... I wanted (want) to believe that somehow a drawer slided out and hit the door and then went back to its place somehow twice ...

Some of the other kids said so and I went with the flow. \n\nI moved a year or two later and never re-connected with her. Sometimes, I wonder if the ghosts were her imagination (probably psych problems) or real. ", "Okay so this was probably 15 ish years ago now. When I was in high school, my group of friends used to spend a lot of time at a particular friend\u2019s house because it was huuuge. It was also quite an old house, but his parents were cool with us basically taking over when we were there - we\u2019d make dinner for about ten people, stay up late listening to music and playing video games and they never minded.\n\nAnyway, one evening we\u2019re all sitting in his room, watching TV. It\u2019s dark and the lights are on but the curtains are open. Suddenly two different people on opposite sides of the room jump like they\u2019ve been startled and look around. Both of them explain they saw in the reflection in the window (on the second floor, just FYI) somebody walk across the room. None of us had moved. It freaked a few of the girls out and we had to calm them down a bit.\n\nFlash to a couple of weeks later, and we found a pack of cards in our friend\u2019s house that had letters on them. Somebody suggested we could use these as a Ouija board and figure out if our friend\u2019s house was actually haunted. We got a big wooden board (I think it might have been the top of a table once upon a time), arranged the cards in a circle around the edge with an extra 2 homemade Yes/No cards, got a glass and off we went. \n\nIt started to answer questions, telling us it was a man who used to live in the house and who died there. We asked when he died and just got the answer \u201clong\u201d. We asked if he was moving the glass, and he said yes. \n\nThis is where I decided to be dumb, and I asked if he could move anything else other than the glass. \n\u201cYes\u201d.\nWe all paused and listened for the sound of something moving, but nothing happened.\nWe asked if he had moved something.\n\u201cYes\u201d.\nNothing happened again so we moved on and asked some more questions. This was at 10.30pm. After a while longer we said goodbye (I think at least one of us was aware enough about Ouija board lore to know we had to close the conversation properly) and then a little later we all went home, a little spooked but enjoying it nevertheless.\n\nI walked home with another friend who lived nearby. As I walked in my front door my Mum called through to me to be careful in my room because a mirror had fallen off the wall earlier and they weren\u2019t sure if they\u2019d picked up all the bits of glass.

He was a great coach and was friends with my friend's dad's and also got them to coach. So here we are in this rinky-dink town and we're running the table on team after team because my coaches actually give a shit. My coaches actually care about the kids. We have organized practices. We have skills we try to develop. Every day we got better. Every game, whether it was a win or a loss we learned something.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nThe last year my dad coached we had this kid on the team. His name was Chad, and he didn't want to be there. He was very overweight (at 12) he probably had asthma. He lacked any sense of competitive instincts and he was a complete introvert.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nThe entire season my dad focused on trying to get him to open up. He tried to get him better and tried to get him to love to play sports. By the end of the season it was starting to work but...you can't coach asthma away just by being positive about it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nSo Chad's mom was at all of the games that year and every tournament. A real winner that woman was. Never cheered for anyone but her son and her son was the absolute...best. For out of town tournaments we used to have the zamboni come on between periods. During that time we'd be in the dressing room. Chad's mom would come in with a burger for her son....to eat between periods 1 and 2. Between 2 and 3....it'd be fries and gravy....just like all the sportstars eat....\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nShe kept track of his minutes. She brought a notepad to every game with a stopwatch and timed how long Chad's shifts were. How often he was passed the puck. How many power play or penalty kill opportunities he got. You know...the full fucking stats package that you'd expect to get...when you're fucking 12 yrs old.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nNear the end of the season and throughout playoffs she would accost my dad, a volunteer coach who had two jobs and three sons to take care of, and bitch him out in the hallway. She would do this within earshot of the dressing room. She'd complain about Chad's time on the ice and show the stat sheets she had accumulated. This we all heard. Chad couldn't have shrunk any lower into his seat.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nWe tried to pump him up but she embarrassed him...every game. EVERY single game she did this. Until at the end of the season she finally got her way and got my dad \"fired\" from his volunteer job.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nMy dad...a former high school and university level coach...fired from his volunteer job...because her son wasn't treated \"equally\".\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI wonder sometimes how that story is spun around Chad's family. I wonder if my dad is cast as the supervillain like some shitty Disney sports movie. I wonder if Chad is always the hero and I wonder whatever happened to him. If all that fighting and pushing by his mom ever ended or did it just continue...for life.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nI'll never know because he quit hockey and never came back.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMeanwhile the rest of the team who had the best-coached hockey in their young lives...lost three amazing coaches because of one fucking nutcase woman.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nParticipation trophies...they're NEVER something a kid demands.

But it was more than that; she also had a bad case of \"wanting to be your 10 year old's best friend instead of their parent\". \n\nHere is a short list of things she did:\n\n* She would come attend school events (like plays, etc), and try to sit next to her child on the floor (\"criss cross apple sauce\" and all)\n\n* She would deliver her child lunch every single day. Not send in a packed lunch, mind you. She would deliver something. Like fast food, especially Chik-fila. And she always had enough for herself as well, so she basically tried to come eat lunch with her daughter every day. One day I confronted the student about this and made up a bogus rule that her mom had to bring me lunch, as well, and sure enough the next day I got a sub from Subway\n\n* She would let the girl stay home for any and all reasons. The girl was literally absent 25 days the year before I had her (although I tried my best to crush that bad habit and got her down to 14 days absent when I had her). Some of the notes / doctors excuses the mom sent in were really ridiculous\n\n* When she was at the school for her younger child (for example: when she came by for kindergarten parties or whatever), she would sneak out and walk the halls and peak through the classroom windows of her other two kids to \"check on them\". I would joke with our principal that this woman might secretly be an employee of our security company trying to find flaws in our security procedures. We had to come up with all sorts of new rules and procedures for all the parents to follow just to stop this one woman.\n\n* The girl was not a very good student, and I am pretty sure more than half of the homework handed in to me was completed by the mother\n\nMy final interaction with her was when I invited her and her husband in for a conference because I gave the girl a 0 for missing an assignment with an unexcused absence and I basically forced the mother to admit that she took the girl shopping that day instead of bringing her to school. The dad was completely unaware this was happening and went off on her. It didn't solve the problem permanently (as she continued to helicopter the following year before leaving the school), but it toned it down while I had her at least.\n\nThe sad thing is you encounter parents like this all the time. They don't realize the long-term harm they are causing their children or the bad habits they are helping them to develop.\n\ntl;dr don't helicopter", "My mom sets up fake Facebook accounts with other peoples' names (like her financial advisor) in order to see if she can view my FB page.\n\nI'm 38.\n\nWhen I was married (age 31-ish) she would reprimand me if I went places (grocery store, dinner with MY friends) without my husband.  My mom is VERY independent.\n\nThis is a family rumor that she denies.  She somehow got through on the phone to my college's president and told him \"My daughter was a good Christian girl until she went to YOUR school.\"  I went to a Christian college.  And I have no doubt that this \"rumor\" actually happened.  She's definitely the type.\n\nWhen I was in high school (age 16-ish) I was allowed to walk 4-6 blocks to school.  No one was ever allowed to use the telephone in the school office except in an emergency.  Except me.  Everyone in town knows my mom AND her reputation, and they bow to her whims because they pick their battles.  So I was required to call my mom every morning when I arrived at school--I had special permission to use the phone.  One morning I forgot, she called the principal, who called over the intercom in my classroom, whether I was in class, because my mom was on the phone wondering if I had made it the 6 blocks to school.\n\nThroughout my 18 years living with my parents, I spent ONE night alone at home.  I was never allowed to be alone.  Even as a teenager, in the rare occasion that both parents were not home overnight, I had to have a babysitter.

For a doctor's office 5 miles from their house that he'd previously been to. Mommy also had to walk him through getting a check, writing the check etc.\nSon was 28 years old, worked full time and was of average intelligence. And he had to bring a check because Mommy didn't allow him to free access to his ATM card or his bank account.", "The kid is about 9 years old - so like 3rd grade, I've known him since before he started school. His mom is an acquaintance of mine and the kid himself has had classes with one of my kids who is the same age.\n\nShe has forced herself in to every activity and classroom that he's ever been in. She starts off volunteering in the classroom normally - most teachers ask for a few hours one or two days a week of help in our school - but little by little she shows up more often whether the teacher asked her to or not. Some teachers have told her to stop, but others just let it happen. \n\nShe basically spends every day all day with him - never gives him any space. She hovers over everything he does and if it's not perfect she \"fixes\" it. Pretty sure she's done his homework herself several times. Sometimes the teachers will send home an art project as homework, like a pumpkin to decorate in the fall or whatever, and his always looks like an adult did it alone. \n\nShe never lets him face any uncomfortable situations or adversity. She got actually mad when one day she said to the 1st grade teacher \"<son> woke up in a sad mood today.\" and the teacher answered \"I'll keep an eye on him, but I think he'll be okay.\". This was infuriating to her to the point where she vented to me about it. I had to ask her \"but was he okay though?\"... yeah. He was. What was she expecting you ask? She wanted the teacher to make a big fuss over him and give him special attention. She felt that the teacher didn't care because she didn't fall all over herself to coddle him.

I'd say it was borderline abuse at points, and she possibly wasn't entirely mentally well. She'd randomly come and pick my friend up while we were out, would monitor the water/gas/electricity in their house whenever she went away to try and see whether my friend had stayed out or had people over. Her mom saw how relaxed my mom was about my life, and definitely took an immediate disliking to BOTH of us pretty early on. \n\nWe once got tickets to a city music festival (the ones where loads of bars/music venues across once city hold performances during the daytime). There was only one act that I reeeeeally wanted to see, at the end of the night, so I spent most of the day trawling around town, drinking and seeing the acts that my friend wanted to see. I was having a good time, but was also sort of counting down the hours until I got to see the band I'd really bought my ticket for. We were planning on meeting some of our other friends there, and managed to organise it all before my phone really annoyingly died during the act before, in another venue across town. My friend's mom (obviously) knew which acts we were planning on seeing and where they were, bear in mind that we were adults, and that this was during the day in what was pretty much our home city. About half an hour before we were about to leave to see the band I'd essentially waited ALL DAY for, my friend's mom called her to say that she'd checked online and saw that the final venue was overcrowded, and that they were turning people away at the door, so she was coming to pick us up and take us home right away. I didn't question this, and was meant to be staying with her family so wasn't about to turn my ride home away. I was kinda disappointed that I'd paid a fair bit of money (to me anyway) to see one of my favourite bands for the first time, and didn't even get the chance, but I'd had a good day regardless so wasn't totally bummed out. \n\nAnyway, we got back to her family's house. I grabbed my phone charger and managed to restart my phone and bring it back to life, only to have a few messages from the friends we had intended to meet at the last venue flash up all at once. Apparently, the venue was hardly full at all and we'd missed out on a really good gig. It was super weird, but I chose not to bring it up even though I was angry about, not only missing out on a good gig for no reason, but also wasting all that money. It's one thing to be a helicopter parent and control everything your kids do, but doing the same thing to your adult kids' friends is just certified crazy.", "I went to boarding school for high school, and when I was a senior there was a freshman whose mother would drive three hours every weekend to be with her. on said weekends her mother wouldn't take her out -- she would hang out with her friends *with* her, to the point where I think the mother thought she was friends with her daughter's friends. field trips? she would go. band tours? she would make sure she was at every place they performed. the mother would try and assign extra homework for her to do on top of her school work, which went on until a dean found out and yelled at the mom.\n\nI went to alumni this year (bff on the alumni board; not just a loser) and I stayed at an old staff member's house, and that happened to be where the class that graduated that year was having a gathering. lo and behold, the girl was there, and so was her mother.", "I was going to move into a dorm with a friend, but her mother contacted administration and insisted that she live in the same residence as the dorm minder to make sure she was doing her homework and staying away from alcohol. We were twenty -- the legal drinking age here is eighteen.
